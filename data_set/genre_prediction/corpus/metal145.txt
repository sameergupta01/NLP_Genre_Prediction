

Ours is not to question the reasons why
Crippled indecision repeats the path I once denied
Insignificant, am I?
The color of sundown, of crimson sky
The beauty that breaks down
And gives the day unto the night

And then one day you'll realize
Just a speck in the spectrum
Insignificant, am I?
And then one day you'll realize
The beauty that breaks down
Never learns the reason why

Scan my horizon as blue turns to black
The sky is gone again
And all beneath are born to die
Insignificant, am I?

And then one day you'll realize
Just a speck in the spectrum
Insignificant, am I?
And then one day you'll realize
The beauty that breaks down
Never learns the reason why

The brother of sundown
Has bleached away my past
To look into the sky
If only for one last time

And then one day you'll realize
Just a speck in the spectrum
Insignificant, am I?
And then one day you'll realize
The beauty that breaks down
Never learns the reason why
