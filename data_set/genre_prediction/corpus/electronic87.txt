
Is this how
You were found?
Like a star fallen
To the ground?

As you fall
You make no sound
As you fall
Wish for a place where you want to be

Lying still, flowers
All around
In my dreams I see you
Falling down

So, is this how (Is this how?)
You are found? (You are found?)
Like a star fallen
To the ground
