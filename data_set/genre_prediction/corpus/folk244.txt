
Yeah
It's about that time that you contact me
To make rhyme and reason of what we did now that it's been a year

Don't clutter your head
I'm fine
Don't clutter your head
It's been some time and I'm fine
Strange
It's almost been a year

And you sound so sweet
You sound so sweet to me

I should know better by now than to pick up that God damn phone
But I don't
And it's almost been a year

And you sound so sweet
You sound so sweet to me
You sound so sweet to me

Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah

Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah

Yeah
It's about that time that you contact me
To make rhyme and reason of what you did now that it's been a year

And you sound so sweet
You sound so sweet
You sound so sweet
You sound so sweet to me
You sound so sweet to me
