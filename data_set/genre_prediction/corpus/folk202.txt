

I met her in the summertime
When her arms
Were the color of silence
So blue her eyes
A new horizon

And I walked that way
And I talked that way too
And I found my way through
To her silence
Whoa
To her silence

My heart was full of bitterness
So dark and so close to violence
The ace of spades
Turned upside down

Nothing beat in my hopeless chest
I could not detect a sound
But she would not let me rest
Bound to my silence
Whoa
Bound to my silence

Love came unexpectedly
Late to the bill
An added attraction
The way it goes
The way it stays

And when she is far away
Still I feel her here
Every since she made the day
And the lonely man disappear
Into that silence
Whoa
Into that silence
