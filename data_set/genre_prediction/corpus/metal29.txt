
At last
Thy fate be sealed

Locked forever within this dirge
No mourning under this dawn
Aghast
Through death - thy life revealed
Your petty loss - more gain than loss

Prepare, the final act
I'll bury you and spade the facts
My eulogy
Hammering nails, decrepit bliss
Crawl the aisle through this hall of blame

Long live your "success"
To many "acts" to mention the excess
Long live your "ambitions"
A grand show of volitions
Long live your "achievements"
For none will be equalled

Locked forever within this dirge
No mourning under this dawn
Aghast
Through life - deranged enmity revealed
A prophet of callous thoughts

The enterrement of your fatal urge
Let them cry out misplaced respect
Now let the curtains drop as dead
