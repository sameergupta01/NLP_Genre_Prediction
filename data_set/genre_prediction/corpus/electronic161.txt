Aaaaaaaaaaah, Aaaaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaaaaah, Aaaaaaaaaah

You got a whole lot left to say now
You knocked all your wind out
You just tried too hard and you froze
I know, I know

What do you say?
What do you say?

Just take the fall
You're one of us
The spotlight is on
(Aaaaaaaaaaah, Aaaaaaaaaah)
Oh the spotlight is on
(Aaaaaaaaaaah, Aaaaaaaaaah)
Oh!

You know the one thing you're fighting to hold
Will be the one thing you've got to let go
And when you feel the war cannot be won
You're gonna die to try what can't be done
Gonna stay stay out but you don't care
Now is there nothing like the inside of you anywhere

Oh just take the fall
You're one of us
The spotlight is on
(Aaaaaaaaaaah, Aaaaaaaaaah)
Oh the spotlight is on
(Aaaaaaaaaaah, Aaaaaaaaaah)
Yeah it's on

Because everyone would rather watch you fall (All and each other)
And we all are, yeah (All and each other)
And we all are, yeah (All and each other)
Just take a fall
You're one of us

The spotlight is on!
(Aaaaaaaaaaah, Aaaaaaaaaah)
Oh the spotlight is on
(Aaaaaaaaaaah, Aaaaaaaaaah)
Just take a fall
Now you're one of us
Now you're, oh! Now you're, oh! Now you're, oh! Now you're one of us
Now you're, oh! Now you're, oh! Now you're one of us
Oh the spotlight is on
Aaaaaaaaaaah, Aaaaaaaaaah
