People say I'm no good
I'm crazy as a loon
'cause I get stoned in the morning,
I get drunk in the afternoon.
Kinda like my old blue tick hound
I like to lay around in the shade.
And I ain't got no money
but I damn sure got it made.
'Cause I ain't askin' nobody for nothin'
if I can't get it on my own.
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
You just leave this long haired country boy alone.

Preacher man talking on TV,
puttin' down the rock and roll.
Wants me to send a donation
'cause he's worried about my soul.
He said, "Jesus walked on the water."
And I know that it's true.
But sometimes I think that preacher man
would like to do a little walking too.
But I ain't asking nobody for nothin'
if I can't get it on my own.
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
you just leave this long haired country boy alone.

A poor girl wants to marry
a rich girl wants to flirt.
A rich man goes to college
a poor man goes to work.
A drunkard wants another drink of wine,
and a politician wants your vote.
I don't want much of nothing at all,
but I will take another toke.
'Cause I ain't asking nobody for nothin'
if I can't get it on my own.
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
you just leave this long haired country boy alone.
