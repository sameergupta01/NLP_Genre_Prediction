I got up this mornin', feelin' sad and blue
I lost my baby now tell me, what I'm goin' to do
You know I'm so lonesome
Way these blues keep doggin' me
Yeah baby but that's all right
I will be up someday

When my baby left me, she left me broken down
She said Goodbye Big Bill, I will see you in another town
Now you know I'm lonesome
Way these blues keep doggin' me
I says that's all right
Big Bill will be up someday

Now I've got to walk by myself, and sleep by myself
On account the one I'm lovin', she keep on lovin' someone else
You know I'm lonesome
Way these blues keep doggin' me
Yeah but that's all right
Baby I will be up someday

If I'd had listened at what my mother said, and did what she said
I'd been home now, sleepin' in a great big bed
Cause I'm lonesome
Way these blues keep doggin' me
Yeah but that's all right
Baby I will be up someday

The men was put on earth to rule, but women are ruling too
Sometimes I wonder what a poor man gonna do
Cause I'm lonesome
Way these blues keep doggin' me
Yeah but that's all right
Way these blues is doggin' me
