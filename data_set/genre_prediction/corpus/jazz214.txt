

Just an ordinary day
till you came around
I had my feet on the ground

so much for that
Just an ordinary day
till you came around
and now my life’s upside down

imagine that
and it’s all because I heard you say
and it’s all because I heard you say
and it’s all because I walked your way

I heard you say x8

and I heard you say Hey hey x8

Oh just right
you got to sit tight
close your eyes
and let your head go down
let your feet up off the ground
and let your head go down
let your feet up off the ground

Just an ordinary day
till you came around
I had my head straight and sound
they’ve told me that

Just an ordinary day
till you came around
and now my life is on the bounce
just like that

and it’s all because I walked your way
and it’s all because I heard you say
and I should've known to stay away

but I heard you say

I heard you say x8

and I heard you say Hey hey
