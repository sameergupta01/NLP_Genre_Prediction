
This is just about as much as I can handle
I'm not nearly strong as I can sometimes seem
My life turned on a dime
And nearly threw me out of time

Same as you
Same as me
Same as everything we've seen
Same as you
Same as me
Same as everything we've seen

Oh and everything is nothing
Cause everything was me
Oh and everything is nothing
Cause everything was me

All of you
All of me
All of everything we've seen
All of you
And all of me
All of everything we've seen

Was all of it for nothing?
Was all of it for me?
Was all of it for nothing?
Was all of it for me?

Turns out that all of it was nothing
Cause everything was me
Turns out that all of it was nothing
Cause everything was me

My my how quickly I'm outside
Of you
My my how quickly everything
That I knew

It turns out that everything is nothing
Cause everything was me
Always everything for nothing
Cause everything for me

Always everything for nothing
Cause everything was me
To you
Everything is nothing
Cause everything was

My my how quickly I'm outside
Of you
My my how quickly everything
That I knew
