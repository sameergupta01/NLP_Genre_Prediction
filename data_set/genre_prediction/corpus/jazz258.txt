

When I, wanna, see right, through you,
Flyin', highin', Freddy voodoo,
Lucid, dreaming, magic, wonder,
Can you, see this, spell I'm, under?
Make you, wander, with that, rhythm,
Feel it, moving, through your, system,
Step on, steppers, step up, to it,
All you, got to, do is, do it.

Do it, yeah yeah,
We come to do it, yeah yeah
We come to do it, yeah yeah
We come to do it, yeah yeah

I got the wandering eye
''Mmm''
I got the wandering eye
''Mmm''
I got the wandering eye
''Mmm''
I got the wandering eye,
Oh you know I got it, oh you know.

Spots on, it's a crazy scene,
Everybody gets a picture in my magazine,
Just like a, paparazzi,
You won't even ask me, no no,
Well all you got to do is,
Just short people look up high,
Can't help but spy from my wandering eye,
Something beginning with the capital cool, capital you, 
If you could only check my view.

We come to do it, yeah yeah
We come to do it, yeah yeah
We come to do it, yeah yeah
We come to do it, yeah yeah
We come to do it, yeah yeah

I got the wandering eye
''Mmm''
I got the wandering eye
''Mmm''
I got the wandering eye
''Mmm''
I got the wandering eye,
Oh you know I got it, oh you know.

Feels like I can't sit still when I got it,
When I got it
All around, hours they keep on searching,
Oh I got it,
Yes I got it.

When will this cease?
Ever gonna end?
Lost my family, I lost my friends.
Faces familiar, far from the same,
Come a little closer, let me know your name.
Ooh step into the light, sweet one
So I can see who you are.
Cross your name in the moonlight, yeah
Cross your name in the streetlight, yeah-eah
You know, you know, you're looking so good,
You're looking so fine, yeah
I can tell by the way that you're looking up high
Sweet one,
Sweet one,
Sweet one,
Sweet one.
I can tell by the way,
By the way,
By the way,
By the way.

I got to look up (''high'')
I got to look up (''high'')
I got to look up (''high'')
I got to look up (''high, yeah'')

I got to look up (''high'')
I got to look up (''high'')
I got to look up (''high'')
I got to look up (''high, yeah'')

I got to look up (''high'')
I got to look up (''high'')
I got to look up (''high'')
I got to look up (''high, yeah'')

(''high'')
(''high'')
(''high'')
(''high, yeah'')
'''''Repeat to end'''''
