Down through the dark trees
You came to save me
You're so ugly and you're so beautiful
You're like no one on Earth could be

Take me home
Let me be the one

All of my life I've been waiting
For you
I wanna be the one that you take home
Let me be the one
Cause I'm so lonely

Take me home
In time you'll love me like one of your own
Take me home
With you
No one on Earth knows me like you do
Take me home
In time you'll love me like one of your own
Take me home
With you
No one on Earth knows me like you do

Down through the dark trees
You came to save me
You're so ugly and you're so beautiful
You're like no one on Earth could be


Take
Take me home
With you
No one on Earth knows me like you do
Take
Take me home
With you
No one on Earth knows me like you do
La la la la....I'm going home
