
DARKENING

And they travelled into the darkening,
I couldn't smile one final mistake,
the frozen tides keep heading south,
my broken home not far from you,
surrender slow I'll move with you,
wherever nothing you lead me to... 

and they travelled into the darkening,
whitening the worlds behind,
we have reached the southern most,
and we want to know why, we want to know why.

wish bound, the time has come to choose alone,
to crack the code while you are young, while we feel strong,
have your revenge rape what you saw,
the midnight sun, arrives so late fourious and fast.

and they travelled into the darkening,
whitening the worlds behind,
we have reached the southern most,
and we want to know why, we want to know why.

and they travelled into the darkening,
whitning the ones behind,
we have reached the southern most,
and we want to know why, we want to know why.

and they travelled into the darkening,
freightining the ones behind,
we have reached the horror most,
and dare not to know why, dare not to know why.

Darkening,
Whitening,
freightining,
Weakining...
