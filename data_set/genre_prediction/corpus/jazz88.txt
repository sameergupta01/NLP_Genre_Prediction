
Standing in the sun
Gazing at a new day
Filling in the blanks
Just another Monday
Waiting for a plane
Take me down there under
Waiting for the past
Waiting for the wonders

Take it to the skies
Make it to the big cloud
Far below the sea
Far away the runner
Think about the speed
Dream about the distance
Far out to the East
Leave behind all western

Cut me a slice of the sky
I wanna drown in your downbeat wonders
Cut me a slice of the grand old world
While trains and boats and planes passing by

Standing in the sun
Feeling like a flower
Looking from a Jackass
In the shadow of the towers
Standing in the heat
Looking at the river
Caught between this now
And the rhythm of forever

Standing in the market
Gazing at the sundown
Curtains falling down down
People pull me under
Can you hear the wild dog
Can you slow the time down
Catching up with new Gods
Lost in all their wonders

Cut me a slice of the sky
I wanna drown in your downbeat wonders
Cut me a nice slice of the grand old world
While trains and boats and planes passing by

Cut me a slice of the sky
I wanna drown in your downbeat wonders
Cut me a slice of the grand old world
While trains and boats and planes passing by
