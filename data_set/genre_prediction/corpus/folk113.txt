let down through the breakthrough
i travel as i hunger for the darkness below me
when i'm praying for the light above
to save this soul inside me

should i? would i? could i?

outcast from my own kind never knowing
soaring through my own mind never knowing
how could they live with what their doing
twist of my spine

oh god fuck

i don't get it
breathe with me
just breathe with me

it's up to me as i hunger
lay slow and still as i wonder
pray for darkness down in this hollow
but i try to grope

it's up to me as i sleep again
my body lays down as i holler
it's all inside but i confess in me
i like me
