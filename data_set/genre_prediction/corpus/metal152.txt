
For some there are no choices

No more will to live, I see the world fade
No more hope inside, my life means nothing anyway
Just shades of gray, I slip away again

Feed me from the heart of your denial
The velvet sleep is conviction only fools know
Dry your own eyes, I can't sympathize
Plague your own dreams, I won't be following

Free me from this sphere of confusion
These tears of dust are the tears from one who knows why
Dry your own eyes, I can't sympathize
Plague your own dreams, I won't be falling

Fly beyond the dreaming, fly beyond our being
Turn and face the mirror, the answers come, clear as glass

Fly beyond the dreaming, fly beyond our being
Turn and face the mirror, the answers come, clear as glass

I still feel you now, you are the falling rain
The voice that stills the pain, I am the lover gone insane
I must be strong, for love burns ever long
