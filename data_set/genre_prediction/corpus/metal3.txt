

As I dissect and reform
A psychopath cankered, by parasites
The lingering corpus of a once dreaded mind, fornever

Resecting this artery infesting disease (disease)
Resecting this artery infesting disease
Cerebrum excavating

So imperfect (a) gluttonous waste of life injected
A sycophantic pathosis
Removal of the cancer that destitutes life

Once upon the slab it becomes discernible
A conceited gob of waste churns the pica
Into a shrouded monstrosity
Torment perfected

A coronary reconstruction momentous
Abolish this cesspool of hypocrisy
Obliterate the disease inside

So arrogant a ignoramus waste of life injected
A sycophantic morphosis
Removal of the cancer that destitutes life

Murderous animus
Coronary excavation achieved
Through scalpel and blade, this carcass redeemed

Once from the slab it becomes animate
A conceited gob of waste expelled
Nothing but a bag of dreck
Torment inflicted

Haemoglobin injected
The pustulent waste rejected


Epicene
Incarnadine
No remorse, no regrets
No odium...


A coronary reconstruction momentous
Abolish this cesspool of hypocrisy
Defect the marasmus which infects the very soul...
