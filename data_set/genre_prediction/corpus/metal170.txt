
Hey, just what have you become
With a cash vindication
Do you think that buys salvation's end?
Do you see through me?
I'm the plastic face on you screen
Mind control

They say that we're in the final days
Religion is power
Because most of us feel like rats in a maze
Do you worship me?
I'm a bastard saint, I'm a sycophant
A parasite that lives for just one goal
Mind control

Send your money to Jesus Christ
Mail order your eternal life
Bend your mind, make you turn around
Don't believe it when they tell you
That eveng god needs money
God needs money from you

Shame can't even make them learn
They feed off the weak
And if there's a hell they're gonna burn
On your screen they worship me
I'm a bastard saint, I'm a sycophant
A parasite that lives for just one goal
Mind control

Hey, just what have you become
With a cash vindication
Do you think thy buys salvation's end?
Do you see worship me?
I'm a bastard saint of the color green
