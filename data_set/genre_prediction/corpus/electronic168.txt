EACH TIME YOU LOOK INTO MY EYES
THE WAY YOU DO BABY

MY BEAUTIFUL BIRD YOU HAVE FLOWN AWAY
I HELD YOU TOO TIGHT I CAN SEE
YOU'RE ALL I NEED TO GET BY
NO ELSE CAN MAKE ME CRY
THE WAY YOU DO BABY

YOU ARE THE BOOK THAT I READ EACH DAY
YOU ARE THE SONG THAT I SING (GONNA SING IT TO YOU)
YOU ARE THE FOUR SEASONS OF MY LIFE
BUT MAYBE TOMORROW YOU'LL CHANGE YOUR MIND GIRL
MAYBE TOMORROW YOU'LL COME BACK TO MY ARMS GIRL
MAYBE SHE'LL COME

NO ONE ELSE CAN MAKE ME CRY
THE WAY YOU DO BABY, CAUSE
