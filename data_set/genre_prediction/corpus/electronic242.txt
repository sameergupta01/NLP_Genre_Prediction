Day and night
I toss and turn, I keep stressin’ my mind, mind
I look for peace, but see I don’t attain
What I need for keeps this silly game we play, game we play, play-ay-ay-ay

Now look at this
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run, but see I’m not that fast
I think im first but surely finish last, finish last, last-ast-ast-ast

Coz day and nite
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He’s all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, ah ah at night

Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, ah ah at night

Ah ah ah ah ah at night
Ah ah ah ah ah at night

Ah ah ah ah ah at night
Ah ah ah ah ah at night

Hold the phone
The lonely stoner missed his solo doe low
He’s on the move, can’t seem to shake the shake
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made

The pain is deep
A silent sleeper, you won’t hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don’t seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through
Through through-ough-ough-ough

Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He’s all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, ah ah at night

Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He’s all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, ah ah at night

Ah ah ah ah ah at night
Ah ah ah ah ah at night

Ah ah ah ah ah at night (x 10)
