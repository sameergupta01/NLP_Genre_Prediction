
15th heir to the ball and chain 
House full of hungry kids to his name 
Everything to lose and nothing to gain 
Long reign Alfred the Great 

Touched his toes down the company store 
Scrubbed till he see his face in the floor 
Lost his place to a foot in the door 
Long reign Alfred the Great 

He never been too good with words oh no 
Said you don't need a Doctor you don't need a Doctor to 
Show 

It's a hard, hard road 
When your folks ain't cracked the code 
And your tears don't put food on the plate, Alfred the 
Great watch out 

Ever get the feeling you been stitched up? 
Textbook case of bad, bad luck 
There's a hole in your bucket and cracks in your cup 
Long reign Alfred the Great 

Touched his toes down the company store 
Scrubbed till he see his face in the floor 
He ain't gonna dance for the suits no more 
Long reign Alfred the Great 

He never been too good with words oh no 
Said you don't need a Doctor you don't need a Doctor to 
Show 

It's a hard, hard road 
When your folks ain't cracked the code 
And your tears don't put food on the plate, Alfred the 
Great watch out 

It's a hard, hard road 
When your folks ain't cracked the code 
And your tears don't put food on the plate, and the 
Rent won't wait, oh no 

It's a hard, hard road 
When your folks ain't cracked the code 
And your tears don't put food on the plate, Alfred the 
Great watch out 
Food on the plate, Alfred the Great watch out
