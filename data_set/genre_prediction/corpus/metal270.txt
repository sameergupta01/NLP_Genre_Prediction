Sick and tired of the same ol' shit.
Fighting battles that I just can't win.
How can you tell me what it is you want
when you don't even know yourself?
Live your life one death at a time,
See the road, can't read the signs.
All the wrongs just can't be right,
Hear my bark for you feel my bite!

If you could only see what you wanted us to see.
If we could only be what you wanted us to be.

I ain't fallin' for the tricks the schemes, the same old lies.
When it's over cry for sympathy,
Don't ask why.

Thanks for nothin'
Yeah I said nothin'
Next time better think before you speak.

I dunno if I can take no more,
I'm baggin' it I'm out the door.
How can you say you know what I mean
as you're pissin' all over my life?
Time is precious, time is mine.
Waitin' here would just be fine.
Bless my soul, time has come,
Tide has turned! see Dick run!!!

If you could only be what you wanted us to be.
If you could only see what you wanted us to see.

Thanks for nothing,
It better be nothing.
Next time better think before you 'speak'!

You never think! before you speak.
Sometime think! before you speak.

I've been watching you.
Barely stand to look you in the face
All tolerance not popularity
There is someone here to take you place

Why don't you think! before you speak.
You never think! before you speak!!!

Thanks for nothing!
Next time better think before you...
Hit the road.
