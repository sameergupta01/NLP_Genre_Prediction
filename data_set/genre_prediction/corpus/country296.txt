

Well I知 going home downhearted and hoping
I知 close to some new beginning
I know there痴 a reason for everything
That comes and goes

But so many people are looking to me
To be strong and to fight
But I知 just surviving
And I may be weak but I知 never defeated
And I値l keep believing
In clouds with that sweet silver lining

Most days I try my best to put on a brave face
But inside my bones are cold and my heart breaks
But all the while something痴 keeping me safe
And alive

But so many people are looking to me
To be strong and to fight
But I知 just surviving
And I may be weak but I知 never defeated
And I値l keep believing
In clouds with that sweet silver lining

And I won稚 give up like this
I will be given strength
Now that I致e found it
Oh, nothing can take that away

But so many people are looking to me
To be strong and to fight
But I知 just surviving
And I may be weak but I知 never defeated
And I値l keep believing

So many people are looking to me
To be strong and to fight
But I知 just surviving
And I may be weak but I知 never defeated
And I値l keep believing
In clouds with that sweet silver lining

Sweet silver lining
