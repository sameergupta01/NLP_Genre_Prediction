
My love I cannot stay
My love I am running late
My love all
Has not been a waste
In a life that you have
Brought upon me

So farewell
Love this is goodbye
Let's not take our time
So farewell
Love this isn't getting
Any easier
And you let go to
What the end will show
Ba ba da ba da da da
