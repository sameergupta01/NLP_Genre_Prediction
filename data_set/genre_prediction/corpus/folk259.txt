
It'll get you on the last bus home,
Get you at the discount bin,
It'll get you on the old dancefloor,
Get you when the party ends,

Oh 4am, is the time when you were mine,
Frozen in deepest sleep, for only I to keep,
Now there ain't a hiding place on earth,
Where loneliness ain't been first,

It'll get you hanging out your clothes,
Get you when you wash your hair,
It'll get you as you're making plans,
Catch you trying to climb the stairs,

Oh 4am, is the time when you were mine,
Frozen in deepest sleep, watching the morning creep,
Now there ain't a hiding place on earth, 
Where loneliness ain't been first,

Hard times, hole in my heart,
You stole the sun and left me alone again,
Give me a guiding light, 
Stretch your sky and the hand on my shoulder, singing,

Hard times, hole in my heart,
You stole the sun and left me alone again,
Give me a guiding light, 
Stretch your sky and the hand on my shoulder,

Oh 4am is the time when you were mine,
Frozen in deepest sleep, for only I to keep,
Now there ain't a hiding place on earth,
Where loneliness ain't been first,
Oh, no
There ain't a hiding place on earth,
Where loneliness ain't been first,
Been first,
Been first
