
It makes me lonely,
It makes me very lonely
When I see you here waitin' on
He makes me tired, he makes me very tired
And inside of me, lingers on

But you have your heart
Don't believe it, and you will find it
Waitin' on
Everything I said, oh, well I meant it
And inside my head, holdin' on


'Cos if I died tonight
Would you hold my hand, no
Would you understand
And if I lived in spite
Would you still be here, no
Would you disappear

Surely must be you
But I don't make you lonely
I'll get over you
But I don't make you lonely
