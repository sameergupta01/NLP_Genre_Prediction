
Run away from all your boredom
Run away from all your whoredom
And wave your worries
And cares goodbye

All it takes is one decision
A lot of guts, a little vision
To wave your worries
And cares goodbye

It's a maze for rats to try
It's a maze for rats to try
It's a race
A race for rats
A race for rats to die
It's a race
A race for rats
A race for rats to die

Sick and tired of Maggie's Farm
She's a bitch with broken arms
To wave your worries
And cares goodbye

It's a maze for rats to try
It's a maze for rats to try
It's a race
A race for rats
A race for rats to die
It's a race
A race for rats
A race for rats to die

Run away
