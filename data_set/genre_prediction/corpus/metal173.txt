

I am throes of my denial
Logic in me crumbles
I take this fateful ride through my mind
Daydream fluid thoughts washing shores of warm confusion

I'm one with this beautiful disorder
Another world, was this the transition?
Slowly I returned to the familiar
Spiralling in constant flux
What have I created?

The experiment is over
