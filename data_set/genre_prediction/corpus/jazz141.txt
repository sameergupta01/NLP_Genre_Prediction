
NAKID MAHEDJAK YA ASSOUF ERHLALAN
What can I do with this eternal longing

IHANIMANIN DOULHIN ERAKHAN
Which inhabits my soul and my heart in flames

KIK IMIDIWAN INDEK ISSANAN

My friends, who can know

AWA ISSASMADHEN OULH ERAKHAN
What can cool a heart that burns



ATHASSAN ADOUNIA NASSADHAN ITRAN
The world sleeps and I count the stars

SADHANAKHAN SAWADHAKN YOULHIN ERKHAN
I count them and I stoke my burning heart

DIHADH TATHAS ADOUNIA INSAN
When everything lies down and sleeps

AHIDITIS ASSOUF SIMAN IKNAN
And suffuses my heart and my soul
