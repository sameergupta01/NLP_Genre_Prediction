time to be free amongst yourselves
your mama told you to be discreet
and keep your freak to yourself
but your mama lied to you all this time
she knows as well as you and i
youve got to express what is taboo in you
and share your freak with the rest of us
cause its a beautiful thing

this is my sexual revolution
