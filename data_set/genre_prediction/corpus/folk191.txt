
The moon she rides the tattered storm
On a ragged gypsy journey
The snow lies on the mountain
Like a cloak upon a king

My dreams go tumbling with the dust
Out across the valley
Blow above the river
Blow above the sea

And life's a sparrow lost at sea
In dark of night with far to go
Dreams are ships that sailed away
We are only cargo
Only cargo

Now the sea has always sung to me
But I have never never headed
I am born a farmer raised the same
Married to the land

But sometimes I will lie at night
While she is softly sleeping
An' far away I hear the song
The sea sings to the sand

For life's a sparrow lost at sea
In dark of night with far to go
Dreams are ships that sailed away
We are only cargo
Only cargo

Only cargo

Adam's prize was open eyes
His sentence was to see
So day by day he's worn awake
Against reality
So gypsies dream of being king
Kings of being free
A sailor longs to till the land
The farmer sets to sea

And the sea will love the land all night
Like a woman loves her lover
The wind will race along the beach
And make the sea cliffs ring

And I will start to wake and dream again
The dream I dreamed forever
The ships I'll never sail
The songs I'll never sing

Sweet life's a sparrow lost at sea
In dark of night with far to go
Dreams are ships that sailed away
The dreamer's only cargo
Only cargo
Only cargo
