
Hereditary, force-fed trauma
Subconsciously enslaved to this pattern wrought
...From the day of conception
...This immaculate deception
Thy retina bleed, to the sights I see

Can one be conceived with this parturient lust?

My gray mass torn asunder
Clarity sought through a vacant glitch
The torment that is mine
From the day I was conceived
My hereditary bane
Following a path of rot
Chromosomes depicting the violence brought
My hereditary bane
A malodorous reign

Watch my every move
Penetration of a knife so smooth
The hunt, the pleasure, the kill
This is the new way,
Extirpate human crud
Redeem society from the filth it is adorned

Watch my every move
Penetration of a knife so smooth
The hunt, the pleasure, the kill
This is the new way,
Extirpate human crud
Redeem society from the filth it is adorned

Watch my every move...
Of homicidal grandeur
Watch my every
First step in a premade design
To end the lives
Of you, pathetic swine
Nothing but shit on a covered wall
I'll do anything to kill you all

Can one be conceived with this parturient lust?
Such easy prey for the deviant in me

Hereditary, force-fed trauma
Subconsciously enslaved to this pattern wrought
...From the day of conception
...This immaculate deception
Thy retina bleed, to the sights I see
