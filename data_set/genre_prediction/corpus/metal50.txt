You fear change and all that's new
stand in the way of progress
like primitive man afraid of fire
'till he explored it's many uses

The power of the atom at our disposal
yet it is called unsafe
nuclear energy so clean and pure
your ignorance is a disgrace

Do not resist
it is your destiny
have we not all become
the children of technology

Holding your fate in a magnetic grip
of all your irrational fears
the shadow of machinery cast upon the flesh of man
blood, sweat, and gears
the robots of dawn offsprings the industry
spot you in the cobalt blue light
one fell swoop and you've become a memory
away with your intrusive life

Into the reactor!

You worship a dead man hung with nails
only a fool would die for the sins of humanity
on your knees before electronics
lets replace this religious insanity
tear down the churches instead on the ground
build there the holy reactors
give us the children science and math
in place of bibles and pastors

You bleeding heart liberals
who oppose the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
must be compelled to retire
you serve only as obstacles and should be used
to fuel the nuclear pyre
