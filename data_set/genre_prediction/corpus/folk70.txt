As the sun is sinking low
and the evening's tucked in tow
On the horizon, my true love I see.
She ain't fancy, she ain't fine
While her fingers number only nine
She's the belle of the ball of the insurgency.

She's my Bandit Queen, lain beneath the moon
In a bandit cave, a blanket laid for two
If I could find a way to your hideaway by the sea
O Bandit Queen, steal away to me.

Somewhere on a mountain, by a starry water fountain
In an alcove hid by some trees
Amidst a pile of treasure, reclining at her leisure,
My ladylove sniffs at the breeze.

And sitting up, she adjusts her turban
And takes another swig from a bottle of bourbon
And listening to the whistling of a train at station
Odds are it will never reach its destination.

'Cause the Bandit Queen, astride her steed will ride
O let me be the on to lay within your theivin' arms tonight.

She's my Bandit Queen, lain beneath the moon
In a bandit cave, there's a blanket laid for two
If I could find a way to your hideaway by the sea
O Bandit Queen, steal away to me.
