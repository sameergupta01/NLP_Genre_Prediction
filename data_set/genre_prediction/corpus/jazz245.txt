Hoo hoo, milkcow, what on earth is wrong with you
Now you have a little new calf, hoo hoo, and your milk is turnin' blue  

Your calf is hungry, and I believe he needs a suck
Your calf is hungry, hoo hoo, I believe he needs a suck
But your milk is turnin' blue, hoo hoo, I believe he's outta luck  

Now I feel like milkin' and my, cow won't come
I feel like chu'in' and my, milk won't turn
I'm cryin' pleease, pleease don't do me wrong
If you can old milkcow, baby now, hoo hoo, drive home

My milkcow been ramblin', hoo hoo, for miles around
