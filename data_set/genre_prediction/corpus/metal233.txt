Here lies before me a road unwalked upon
I am prepared to be the first to walk on shadowed stones
That none has dwelled before
The holy ones stand alert, they await if I might fall
They who pass judgement upon us all
Won't see your darkened face
Won't see your black embrace that makes my fire blaze
The path ahead, a neverending way

And all the words you said to me about the life
That could have been so pure like a knife made of gold
And I feel the tremors in my soul
That lead me now into a fall
Which seems like a neverending way
