
From dark waters I rise
My once trembling shell conceals a God

Power surging through the void I soar
Intoxicating visions whispering more
In my radiance every color
Seems to fade

I've learned to cry and crawl away
But at the closing of our circle you will pay
I see the hope vanish in your eyes
I feel the ecstasy in me arise

I speak only in thought
Life is not forever nothing is forever
In dark waters I find
Beauty beyond oceans of time

Power surging through the void I soar
Intoxicating visions whispering more
In my radiance every color
Will soon fade away
In the emptiness I will no longer stay

I've learned to cry and crawl away
But at the closings of our circle you will pay
I see the hope vanish in your eyes
I feel the ecstasy in me arise
