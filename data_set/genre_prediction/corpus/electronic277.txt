
We've been broken down
To the lowest turn
Bein' on the bottom line
Sure aint no fun

But if we should be evicted
Huh, from our homes,
We'll just move somewhere else
And still carry on

Oh

(hold on) hold on
(hold on) hold on
Ooooh, aah, baby

(hold on) hold on
(hold on) ooh oooh aah

(Chorus)
The only way is up, baby
For you and me now
The only way is up, baby
For you and me now

Aaaaah...

Now we may not know, huh,
Where our next meal is coming from,
But with you by my side
I'll face what is to come

Aaah, 
Boy I want to thank you,
Yeah, for loving me this way
Things may be a little hard now
But we'll find a brighter day

Oh yeah,
(hold on) hold on
(hold on) hold on
Ooooh, oooh ooh

(hold on) hold on
(hold on) won't be long, 
Oh yeah

The only way is up, baby
For you and me now
The only way is up, baby
For you and me now
Oooo ooh ooooooooh....

(spoken)

Talk about the only way is up, baby
Talk about the only way

Talk about the only way is up, baby
Talk about the only way
Talk about the only way is up, baby

(hold on) hold on
(hold on) hold on
Hey

(hold on) hold on
(hold on) won't be long, 
No no no

The only way is up, baby
For you and me now
The only way is up, baby
For you and me now

The only way is up, baby
For you and me now
The only way is up, baby
For you and me now....
