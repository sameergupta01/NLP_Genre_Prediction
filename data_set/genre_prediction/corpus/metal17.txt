
[Music: Bart, Lyrics: Sven]

My name is Ted, indifferent to laws I strangle and maim women
January 4, ramming the betrod into her her cattered vagina
Incapable, defined is the hatred that lead to this carnage

Infested by love, a stone cold killer,
hacking and gnashing without remorse
Pipe fed to her cave, blinded by rage
I lacerate her lie spreading throat

Again I hack, enjoying every blow
I batter her cunt into pulp

Victims are idealized, a predestined massacre
Invaginated by the bedrod, crushing the uterus

Strangulation is not enough, brutaly I swing the pole,
inter her meaty beefhole... Injaculating thrill... I'm in for the kill...
Forced fed is my will, the pole rests in her vagina still

Infested by love, a stone cold killer,
hacking and gashing without remorse
Pipe fed to her cave, blinded by rage
I lacerate her lie spreading throat
