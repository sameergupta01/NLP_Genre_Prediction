Folks said that you found someone new
To do the thing I used to do for you
Just call my name, I'm not ashamed
I'll come running back to you

Can't sleep at night, I can't eat a bite
When you were mine I didn't treat your right
Just call my name, I know, I know I'm not ashamed
I'll come running back to you

Just like a king, I've lost everything
I sit all alone on my throne
I've got my pride but deep down inside
I'm yours, I'm yours alone

I try to forget, had no regrets
This love of ours could always start anew
Just call my name, wooh, I know I'm not ashamed
I'll come running back to you
