Grinding gears and machinery
Apparatus gesticulate
Constructed, an automated hell
Avernus incarnate - the immaculate it allures
A cold calculated device

Extruding meat with expertise
Refining a cankerous heap
To expose a delicatesse, with grand rigour
A protein loaded plat de resistance
The maitre D standing in awe

Finally a potent banquet
Canning up fresh head - soufflé
A Voracious smelly hors - d'oeuvre
For the mass to reconsume their brood
Canning up fresh head - soufflé
For the mass to reconsume their brood
Canning up fresh head - soufflé
For the flock to rejoice in rancidity

Grinding gears and machinery
The Apparatus gesticulate
Constructed, an automated hell
The Apparatus gesticulate
A murder contrivance made

A wholesome feature, snarling concoction,
A heaving organic mess
Mongrels are feeding, led down believing, their minds too ignorant

Such a culinary incest, eat the rot, gangrenous plot
Such a culinary feast, eat the rot, best served hot
Avernus incarnate - the immaculate, it allures
A cold calculated device

Grinding gears and machinery
The Apparatus gesticulate
Constructed, an automated hell
The Apparatus gesticulate
A murder contrivance made
Extruding meat with expertise
Refining a cakerous heap
