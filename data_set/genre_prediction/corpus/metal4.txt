
This Lingering odor
An abrasive scent to most yet a perfume I adore
Operating doors
Enfold a corpuscle that strolls in
to fulfill my needs

Obnoxious gangrenous obsession
A malodorous confession once I

Commence the Y - incision, reveal the bouquet of perfume within
The smell of plaguing chyme Is nauseatingly compelling...

Smell the rot, a goreastic plot...
Prolonging spumescence to re-enrich the reek...
Bacterial excoriation releasing an aroma so sweet...

A heaving puzzle of gore...
An abrasive act to some yet a profession I adore...
The intestinal tracts sets to the fore...
A luscious banquet of feces so delightfully emetic...

Consciously addicted I reveal
A bouquet of carnal rot
Lewd demeanor of a brilliant mind...
from a tepid whiff...

Your cadaver I corrupt...
Nothing but an emptied husk...
Your decayed remains I defile...
Parturient to my grand smile...

Obnoxious gangrenous obsession
A malodorous confession...

Bathing in globulous rot...
With feces I am adorn...
Entranced by the stench of manure...
Parturient to my grand smile...

Obnoxious gangrenous obsession
A malodorous confession...
Satisfied by the aromatic holocaust I wreaked
A pungent infatuation from the ass cheek bereaved...
