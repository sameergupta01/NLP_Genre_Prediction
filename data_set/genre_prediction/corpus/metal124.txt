
The rush I get when I'm makin' a break yeah
It's that cracked out, whacked out look on your face man.
Nothing like a ragamuffin making a handplant
While I'm pushing all the buttons of a ruthless villian... 

Oh yeah, Oh no. Bip.
Oh no. Switch. 

Got 'em now it's a damn good feelin'. Oh yeah.
So ya think I'd give up that easy? Oh no...
Oh so long with the pain right hear man. Oh shit you can't take it.
This one goes to the brothas that I'm feelin'. Oh yeah. 

Cash and carry in the Dog Eat Dog system,
Me, myself, I and I was a victim.
Playin' games the rules are suit to fit them
They're getting rich on a tip that's abusive... 

'Cause he kills two friends, and he kills two friends, and so on, and so on... Bip
Oh yeah, Oh no. Switch 

Got 'em now it's a damn good feelin'. Oh yeah.
So ya think I'd give up that easy? Oh no...
All this time with the pain in my mind. Oh shit you can't take it.
This one goes to the Northern Valley Skate Posse. Oh yeah. 

It's a Dog Eat Dog world. Dog Eat Dog. 

Got 'em now it's a damn good feelin'. Oh yeah.
So ya think I'd give up that easy? Oh no...
All this time with the quarrel in my mind. Oh shit you can't take it.
This one goes to the 076 crew. Oh yeah. 

It's a Dog Eat Dog world. Dog Eat Dog
