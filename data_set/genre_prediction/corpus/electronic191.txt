I enter the temple of holy love
and shout your name to God above.
I tell myself this is no game,
I only hope you feel the same.

They say that love's a two way thing
and all of the pleasures it may bring.
But our love will never be
until you give yourself to me.

[chorus 1]
How can I love you more?
How can I love you more?
Please tell me,
how can I love you more?
I give you a love so pure.

Loosing you would make me feel
helpless, weak, alone, unreal.
Life I could not contemplate,
I need your love don't make me wait.

Don't tell me it's not enough,
I try so hard don't be so tough.
I never felt this way before.
I'm sick, and baby, you're my cure.

[chorus 2] [x2]
How can I love you more?
How can I love you more?
Oooh baby,
How can I love you more?
I give you a love so pure.

[chorus 1]
