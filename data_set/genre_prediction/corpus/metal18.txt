
[Music: Bart, Lyrics: Sven]

Reflected on the iris, A tale each stiff reveals
Numbing - depresonalisation
Surgical doctrines transmute to malevolance
A morbid fascination, medical expertise befouled
To ensure intravenous butchery...

Single handed and scalpel guided,
Life chors are sliced
Practitioners of a medical deviance
Rigor mortis sets in, achieving thrills
the doctor is in...

Thrusting tools incyst,
our minds are tools that wreck
The bonesaw abused, 
your spleen removed, dissection in progression
Sterilised tools incyst,
our minds are tools that wreck
The bonesaw abused,
your spleen removed, dissection in progression

Reflected on the iris, A tale each stiff reveals
Numbing - depresonalisation
Surgical doctrines transmute to malevolance
A morbid fascination, medical expertise befouled
To ensure intravenous butchery...

Single handed and scalpel guided,
Life chors are sliced
Practitioners of a medical deviance
Rigor mortis sets in, achieving thrills
the doctor is in...

Let us cut your artery
Let us trip your humanity
Let us drain you profusely
Let us expose you completly

Sterilised tools incyst,
our minds are tools that wreck
The bonesaw abused,
your spleen removed, dissection in progression

Hooks and screws,
tools abused
Blood debouched,
stiffs retouched
