
You're comin' tonight
To my home town
I've been to yours many times before
And it's always been a thrill

You'll stay in a hotel
Or at friends near by
We haven't spent the night together in this town
Since nineteen seventy nine
Not such a long time

I can steal a melody
Of this I am allowed
'Cause you would never sue me baby
It wouldn't look good, it'd be weird

Have a drink after the show
I might really want to know
But everything you say I oppose
I blame it on my hole
It's just my role

I can steal a melody
Of this I am allowed
'Cause you would never sue me baby
It wouldn't look good, it'd be weird

I spend my time trying to forget you
With booze and smoke from cigarettes and dope
I only seem to forget myself
It's only you that is left

I can steal a melody
Of this I am allowed
'Cause you would never sue me baby
I can steal a melody
This I am allowed
You would never sue me baby
It wouldn't look good, it'd be weird
It'd be weird, it'd be weird

You're comin' tonight
To my home town
