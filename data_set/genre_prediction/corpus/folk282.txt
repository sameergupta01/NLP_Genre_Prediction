
We'd watch the shapes the rain would make
Falling down the window of our bus
I said they reminded me of paper ponies blowing free
You said they reminded you of us

Your belly in my arms
Tomorrow we'll be through these rains and gone

Woke up with the driver crying Birmingham
Looked through the glass and found the morning sky
I said that cloud's shaped like a burning man
You didn't have the heart to tell me why

Your belly in my arms
Tomorrow we'll be through these clouds and gone

I put my hand inside your skirt
And asked if you thought that our babies life would turn out this way
You said you wasn't really sure
But really you was too good to say it

Your belly in my arms
Tomorrow we'll be through these rains and gone
Your belly in my arms
Tomorrow we'll be through these gates and gone
