1. Fare thee well my lovely Dinah,
A thousand times adieu
For we’re going away from the Holy Ground,
And the girls we all love true
We will sail the salt seas over,
And then return for shore
To see again the girls we love,
And the holy Ground once more
FINE GIRL YOU ARE
You're the girl that I adore,
But still I live in hope to see
The holy Ground once more
.
2. And now the storm is raging,
And we are far from shore
And the good old ship is tossing about,
And the rigging is all tore
And the secret ofmy life, my love,
You're the girl that I adore
But still I live in hope to see,
Holy Ground once more
FINE GIRL YOU ARE
You're the girl that I adore,
But still I live in hope to see
The holy Ground once more
.
3. And now the storm is over,
And we are safe and well
We will go down to a public house,
And sit and drink like hell
We will drink strong ale and porter,
And we’ll make the rafters roar
And when our money is all spent,
We will go to sea once more
FINE GIRL YOU ARE
You're the girl that I adore,
But still I live in hope to see
The holy Ground once more, FINE GIRL YOU ARE
