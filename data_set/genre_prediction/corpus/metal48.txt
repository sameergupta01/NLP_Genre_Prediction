A grey and sunless sky above lies heavy on the earth
fire storms acid rain celebrating birth
fall on down to corpses rotting in the streets
baste in their own blood upon the pavement from the heat

Maggots crawl from festering sores soon will turn to flies
spread disease across the land to the lucky who've survived
minds asleep are restless with reminiscent desire
sinners writhe in pain and fright baptism by fire

Chorus

Cities once great of stone and steel now lie black and burning
drifting far and fast away a dying world stops turning
a shroud of darkness steals the earth its solar womb
hopelessly I've given up prepared to meet my doom

Chorus
