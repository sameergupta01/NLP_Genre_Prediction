
Snakebite
Spitting spiders eyes
They swallowed up the night
Cried 'Meltdown
Zero Marsh of lava'
With supersonic sight
And barriers of you and me
Piled 1500 high
Spread here to there in smoking cans
We blackened out the sky
King met king
We heard the bell
They kicked away the board
Flew headfirst to the bunkers
Then they started out once more
And you and me were born again
As iron plated pawns
We scorched our way through libraries
We shredded all the lawns
'Til everything was rust and powder
Every stone was turned
And random programmes re-arranged
The areas to burn
The enemy is years ahead
He's tapped into the phone
He hides beneath the furniture
Knows all the special codes
The enemy's our destiny
He's pulling on the cord
He spits a line, I spactic dive
And sell him his reward
I perform
