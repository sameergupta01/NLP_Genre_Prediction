
Here comes the rain
Making my skies cloudy again
There goes the tide
There goes my heart, burning alive

This was an old rodeo
In the long ago
Now it's a burning ring of fire
Turning my bad desires

Here comes the rain
Hounding old coney island again
Here come the sharks
Tearing my good neighbours apart

Where is that old movie screen
That my eyes have seen
Where are your warm summer winds
Where's my lover been

Ambulance man
Please let me ride
I'm at the end
Ambulance man
I'm at the end

Here comes the rain
Making my bones quiver again
Here come the freaks
Tearing the children from their seats

That's where the turnstile had been
Where we'd all file in
Now it's a burning ring of fire
Turning my real desires

Ambulance man
Please let me ride
I'm at the end
Ambulance man
I'm at the end tonight
