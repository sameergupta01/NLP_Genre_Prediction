When your love is pouring like the rain
I close my eyes and its gone again
When will I get the chance to say I love you?
I pretend that you're already mine
That my heart ain't breaking every time
I look into your eyes

If only I can get through this
If only I can get through this
If only I can get through this
God, God, gotta help me get through this

I gotta get through this
I gotta get through this
I gotta make, gotta make, gotta make it through
Said I'm gonna get through this
I'm gonna get through this
I gotta take, gotta take my mind off of you

Give me just a second and I'll be all right
Surely one more moment couldn't break my heart?
Give me till tomorrow and I'll be okay
Just another day and then I'll hold you tight
