
Her name was ruby mae
she danced the cabaret
such a lovely girl was she
that ruby mae

in the open window breeze
she pulled her stockings
above her knees
such a lovely girl was she
that ruby mae

on a lonely winter night
i followed her under christmas lights
so low down was i
to ruby mae

in the bitter morning air
i hid her body there
in the heart of old times square
so she'd not lose her way

her name was ruby mae
she danced the cabaret
such a lovely girl was she
