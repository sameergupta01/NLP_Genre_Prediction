I bid you welcome
To my shadowland
I'm coming soon
And the moon is full I am the prince of night
Please do come in
I am the last of my kind
The last in line Heavy load
Down the winding road
Heavy load here
Come and show
The way to paradise
Let me know now Fell the fire strong desire
Something's waiting there for me
Deep inside I have a feeling
This was meant to be
Drifting on a river blue
I'll sail my ship forever
Let me live the dream I carry
Don't wake me from my sleep Living ain't easy
When there is no release
So many hearts been broken
Too many shattered dreams
It's hard building bridges
In this shadowland
I've been rising from the fall
When it was too much to bear Heavy load
Down the winding road
Heavy load here
Come and show
The way to paradise
Let me know now
Why? Fell the fire strong desire
Something's waiting there for me
Deep inside I have a feeling
This was meant to be
Drifting on a river blue
I'll sail my ship forever
Let me live the dream I carry
Don't wake me from my sleep
