When the time is right you got to get up and fight
When your number's up you gotta get up and die

Would you walk five blocks to meet me
That skin will get numb

How many times have you been mistreated
How many times have you been mislead
They brought this nightmare to life
All we wanted was to be respected
Learned our lessons, and don't you ever forget
We stand larger than life
What if I lost it

It was said and done but I needed some more,
I hadn't had enough, kept kicking in doors

Would you walk five blocks to meet me
That skin will get numb

How many times have you been mistreated
How many times have you been mislead
They brought this nightmare to life
All we wanted was to be respected
Learned our lessons, and don't you ever forget
We stand larger than life
What if I lost it

Convicted with no excuse
Just pull the trigger, I got nothin' to lose
Disputed I will not be locked down
Split lipped with nothin' to lose
I never really change my point of view
Dispute it, the victim is you...
I will not be locked down

How many times have you been defeated
How many times have you been depressed
How many times have you taken the beating
How many times have you been put to the test
All we wanted was to be respected
Learned our lessons, and don't you ever forget
We stand larger than life
What if I lost it

Would you walk five blocks to meet me
That skin will get numb
