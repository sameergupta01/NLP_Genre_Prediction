To see the last survivor fall
To see their bastard sons against the wall
To see the emptiness as we decay
I see the world is dead, I am betrayed
Dead heart in a dead world
Dead heart in a dead world

This rotten hole that I call home
Bled dry again
This lesion marked upon my soul
Left an empty hanging man
Across the fields, into the sea
To find the light from within
Out of this lake I've tried to crawl
I think I'm there and then I fall

Burn your gods and kill the king
Subjugate your suffering
Dead heart in a dead world

We must remember wounds so deep
Take time to heal
And sometimes though we struggle still
Life seems surreal
Emotions turned to cold dead wood
Can still have life once more
The door that slammed upon your heart
Torn away, torn away

Burn your gods and kill the king
Subjugate your suffering
Dead heart in a dead world
Dead heart in a dead world
