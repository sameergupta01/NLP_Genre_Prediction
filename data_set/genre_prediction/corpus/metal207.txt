
I think strange things, which I dare not confess to my own soul
As it I'm playing a part in a story, which is not known to me
I have many bad memories
Be warned

Light of the blazing fires fills the darkened sky

Well, you know just as well as I do that
A bitch must drink 10 times her bodyweight in pain each day
Else her own blood cells will die
So why don't you just feeding your demons
I lick the lies from your lips

From a thousand miles I hear your cry

Lend me your ears
Lend me your body
And I'll take your soul

Once again you have awakened
