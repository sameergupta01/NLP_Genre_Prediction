
Like honey in my mouth
Gold golden goin' down
I shudder with wonder at what we will feel like together
I'm wrapped up like a gift
Cut ribbon feel me drift
Petal by petal the sweeter the deeper for waiting
Our wild weather exquisite and violent could never betray me
It slays me and I live to die again in your arms
Hold back outside the door don't touch me anymore
Hand barely touching hand
The full weight of you on top of me sleeping
And when you wake
I'm awake
