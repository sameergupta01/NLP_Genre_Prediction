Apologize
Wipe your eyes out
No one's there
They can't care
'cause you suck it out
Apologize
In disguise
All they see is your lies and your tries
You apologize
What you fear


And you'd be surprise what they really hear
So you try again
More you say
You are at the wheel driving them away
Apologize
Wipe your eyes out
No one's there
They can't care
'cause you sucked it out
