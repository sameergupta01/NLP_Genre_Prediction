

some blues are just blues, mine are the 
lonesome blues
some blues are just blues, mine are the 
lonesome blues

my baby left me
hitched a train down south
my baby left me
hitched a train down south
i still taste his kisses
like candy in my mouth

i wish i had wings, just like an aeroplane
i wish i had wings, just like an aeroplane
fly down, find my baby
never be lonesome again
