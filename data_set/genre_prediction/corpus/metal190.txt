
Hear our Mother crying in silent tears
For she can't speak, she only cries She cries to me
Draw the final curtain, for senseless thoughts
And senseless hands have shaped the future
Is it not what you thought would come?
Or maybe people no longer care for Mother Earth
Earth Mother is screaming, we can't live without her
No time left for dreaming here, she knows Have we forgot our future?
Earth Mother, life giver, we can't live without her
So foolish, men who say they don't care
They'll be gone anyway
Feel our
Mother nurture, for we are the children
Suckling at her breasts she gives us life, she give us all we need
What do we give in return for life we take from her?
Oh, forgive us Mother, forgive us
For we know what we do We've blistered and burned you
Our kind may soon be through, we've raped you Earth Mother is screaming,
we can't live without her
No time left for dreaming here, she knows
Have we forgot our future?
Earth Mother, life giver, we can't live without her
So foolish, men who say they don't care
They'll be gone anyway Earth Mother is screaming,
we can't live without her No time left for dreaming here, she knows
Have we forgot our future?
Earth Mother, life giver, we can't live without her
So foolish, men who say they don't care
They'll be gone anyway
Think of our little ones,
for whom the world has just begun....
