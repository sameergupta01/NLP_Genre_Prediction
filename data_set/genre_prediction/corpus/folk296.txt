
Very soon I will be 
In the deep blue sea
Wrapped in chicken wire
By my own device

The navy'll come
The sharks will bite
It will be so hard to fight
Wrapped in chicken wire
By my own device

Mama, don't go
Mama, don't leave me, Lord

Wall to wall
The carpet crawls
Up the stairs and down the hall
To the invalid
In his dying bed

Upon the floor
The guests will step
And everyone will leave 
Except the invalid in his dying bed

The maid'll call
The ambulance
As the children dance
To Billie Jean
By the neighbor's fence

The medics'll come 
Haul him away
And as they leave, they'll sweetly say
I'm sorry, ma'am, but it's for the best

Mama, don't go 
Mama, don't leave him, Lord

So very soon
I will be
In the deep blue sea
Wrapped in chicken wire
By my own device

The navy'll come
The sharks will bite
It will be so hard to fight
Wrapped in chicken wire 
By my own device

Mama, don't go
Mama, don't leave me, Lord
