I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees
Down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees
Asked the Lord above for mercy, "Take me if you please."

I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride
Down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride
Nobody seemed to know me, everybody passed me by.

Well, I'm going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side.
Going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side.
You can still barrelhouse, baby, on the riverside

You can run, you can run, tell my friend poor Willie Brown.
Run, you can run, tell my friend poor Willie Brown.
And I'm standing at the crossroads, believe I'm sinking down.
