
[Music: Bart, Lyrics: Sven]

Apathy raised upon childhood, Social skills erased
Automaticly blocking of any contact, Eomtions numbed
The anger grows within me...
I'm a walking human time bomb
Adrenaline thrusting in my blood flow,
morals collapse... Barriers fade as I take control...

With the first blow of the hammer, My mind's unblocked
Feelings I only dreamt of having, A psychic extacy
Murder becoming my sole comfort, Regressed for so long
Your body, my canvas of exploration, My playground of pus

Becoming, A self made god, a tool moulded by society
A - a nemesis of man, The emotions of which I'm fuelled
Result of social abuse, murder takes control

Another death ensued, another asshole entombed

[Leads: Bart]

With the first blow of the hammer, My mind's unblocked
Feelings I only dreamt of having, A psychic extacy
Murder becoming my sole comfort, Regressed for so long
Your body, my canvas of exploration, My playground of pus
Again I hack.
