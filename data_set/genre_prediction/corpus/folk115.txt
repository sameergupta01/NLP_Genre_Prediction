So you just drive Mr Baylis
Don't you worry 'bout the weather
I asked the rain to hold off
And so far it looks just fine
We're only halfway through our journey
But I think we're gonna make it
And you can sleep when darkness comes around
Coz this road's the only thing that holds you down

Clear your mind we don't have time to plan
You can leave your worries, we'll outrun them if we can
And when you're blind from white lines
And your eyes are turning red
There's another world just waiting up ahead

And even my weaknesses says
We're gonna be just fine
And staying is the last thing on my mind
