In 1814 we took a little trip
along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip.
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
and we caught the bloody British in the town of New Orleans.

*Chorus*
We fired our guns and the British kept on comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago.
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.

We looked down the river and we've seen the british come
and there must have been a hunnerd of 'em beatin on the drum.
They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring
but we stood behind our cotton bales 'n' didn't say a thing.

Chorus

Ol' Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise
if we didn't fire our muskets 'till we looked 'em in the eyes.
We held our fire 'till we seed their faces well
then we opened up the squirrel guns and really gave em....
well we

Chorus

Well they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
and they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go.
they ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.

We fired our cannon 'till the barrel melted down
so we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round.
We filled his head with cannonballs, powered his behind
and when we touched the powder off the gator lost his mind.

Chorus

Yeah they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
and they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go.
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
A down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
