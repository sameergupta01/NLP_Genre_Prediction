
won't you let me give you a hand
i have an extra I'm not using
won't you let me lighten your load
i mean after all your legs are shaking

and i can understand
all i need is your hand
oh won't you take the fall
it is me after all

won't you let me match your stride
i can slow down if you want to
we can handle it side by side
what do you say girl don't you want to

and i can understand
all i need is your hand
oh won't you take the fall
it is me after all

I'd be lying
if i ran away
I'd be lying
if i ran another way

and so I'll stay

but won't you let me be your man
I'm strong enough you know that i can
be the one to ease your mind
ease your mind

and i can understand
all i need is your hand
oh won't you take the fall
it is is me after all

I'd be lying
if i ran another way
I'd be lying
if i ran another way
and so I'll stay

won't you let me give you a hand
i have an extra I'm not using
won't you let me lighten your load
i mean after all your legs are shaking

and i can understand
all i need is your hand
oh won't you take the fall
it is me after all
[x2]

there's not much that you can do
to get me to run away from you
[x6]

I'd be lying
if i ran away
I'd be lying
if i ran another away
