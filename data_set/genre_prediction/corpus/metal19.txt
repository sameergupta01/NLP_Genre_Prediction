
[Music: Thijs, Lyrics: Sven]

A quick grasp of insanity, cranial tissue in decay
A force fed tool of apathy i am
Parasitic life form, infesting my whole being
Necrotic fungus resecting organs to create...

From the realm of the dead I'm fed
Cracking open the coffin lid

Driven by a hunger, unable to grasp
A chemical reaction that campels me to grab
The axe, anxiously removed from its shelve
With an unpredescent joy I brutally hack

Psychonecrotic hallucinations,
as my skull begins to reek
With goreastic elegance I purge the weak

Parasitic life form
Rehashing the dead for its cause
The chopping of heads
A daily act of self-enjoyment

Cranial metamorphosis,
A forensic decrepit anomaly
Intestines turn into pulp
Axe wielding among the stiffs
Parasitic resection...
