

Worship my name...
Known by many and as many or one
For I am a cancer crawling it's way
Through an already cankered world
I am impetuous, I am the serpent
Through carrion and disease I spread my darkest needs

The symbolism of misanthropy
It's foul nature revealed
Decrepit solitude, the story of my life
A tell tale of blood and debris
Depicting a horrid voyage with luscious wrath

These eyes: cold an calculated, deep within I'm a psychopath
Victimized: cleansing the weak and sloth, deep within I bring saviour and death

The symbolism of misanthropy
It's foul nature revealed

Insane? indoctrinate - religiously I decapitate

Ophiolatry in excess, pleasuring this chopped off mess
Hemocite platter, flooded with lugubrious matter
Regressive thoughts, pleasuring this chopped off mess
Saw and hooks abused, blood now a religious tool

When all is said and done, all that's left is a world of rot
Dare to realize, dare to idealize
Through carrion and disease
Man has spread his decayed wings

A society torn by rage and deceit
And all your lives are lost...

These eyes: cold an calculated, deep within I'm a psychopath
Victimized: cleansing the weak and sloth, deep within I bring saviour and death

The symbolism of misanthropy
It's foul nature revealed

Insane? indoctrinate - religiously I decapitate
A new way - this living hell - ambitiously I crave
