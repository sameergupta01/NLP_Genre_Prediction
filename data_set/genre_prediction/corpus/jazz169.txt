
Who's the black private dick 
That's a sex machine to all the chicks? 
(Shaft)
You're damn right

Who is the man 
That would risk his neck for his brother man?
(Shaft)
Can you dig it?

Who's the cat that won't cop out 
When there's danger all about?
(Shaft)
Right on

They say this cat Shaft is a bad mother
(Shut your mouth)
But I'm talkin' 'bout Shaft
(Then we can dig it)

He's a complicated man
But no one understands him but his woman
(John Shaft)
