

There's just three chances in your life
To shine in the sun
Take them, live through them
They show you how to love

Youth is fleeting and sweet
Full of wonder, then falling away
Turn and you're grown, earning wisdom
Then you'll grey like a leaf in the autumn

Life just somehow passed by
Chances three
Life's sweet memories
All in the blink of an eye

Who's to say where we're going
I won't struggle to try
Chances three
Life's sweet memories
To take to the other side
Just three chances

Youth is fleeting and sweet
Full of wonder, then falling away
Turn and you're grown, earning wisdom
Then you grey till the wind calls your name

Chances three
Life's melody
Cryptic symphony
And we dance on the strings
Chances three
