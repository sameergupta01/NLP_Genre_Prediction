It's you, and me 
Movin' at the speed of light into eternity (yeah) 
Tonight, is the night 
To join me in the middle of ecstasy 
Feel the melody and the rhythm of the music go 'round you, 'round you

So don't be scared, I'm right here, baby we can go anywhere 
Go anywhere 
But first, it's your chance 
Take my hand 
Come with me 

It's like I waited my whole life 
For this one night 
It's gon' be me, you, and the dance floor 

'Cause we only got one night 
Double your pleasure 
Double your fun 
And dance forever ever ever 
Forever ever ever

Forever on the dance floor 

Feels like were on another level (ohh ahh) 
Feels like our loves intertwine 
We can be two rebels 
Breakin' the rules

Me and you 
You and I 
All you gotta do is watch me 
Look what I can do with my feet, baby 
Feel the beat inside 

I'm drivin', you could take the front seat (front seat) 
Just need you to trust me (trust me) 
Girl girl girl

It's a long way down 
We so high off the ground 
Sendin' for an angel to bring me your heart 
Girl where did you come from?

Got me so undone 
Gaze in your eyes got me sayin'
What a beautiful lady 
No if's, and's, or maybe's
 
I'm releasin' my heart 
And it's feelin' amazing 
There's no one else that matters 
You love me

And I won't let you fall girl 
Let you fall girl (ahh ohh oh oh yeah)
