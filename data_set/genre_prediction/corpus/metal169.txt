
Here I come again like the sun
The question on your thoughts' horizon
The quest is in learning theology
Pouring logic and opinion in me

One step closer
Everything comes back to you in time
One step closer
Some will find the answers
Some submit to aggression

From the dust of Adam's rib she hides
The muse in my tragic comedy of lies
Sharpened emotions imprison me
Stagnant revulsion for society

Come with me, sail the sea of possibilities
In liquid karma, I don't mean to alarm you
But the future is not written in stone
