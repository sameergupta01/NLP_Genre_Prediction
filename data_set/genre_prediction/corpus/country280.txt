

If you can say that you don't love me
If you can look me in the eye
and say that you don't love me
I could say goodbye
If you can tell me you won't miss me
And sound convincing when you say
You won't miss me
I could walk away.

Cause i don't have a point to prove
Or a stand to make
I'm just trying to find my way
And a face to wear
And a place to be
In the absence of your company.

If you're better off without me
If you truely do believe
that you are better off without me
Thats how you should be.

Cause I don't have a point to prove
Or a stand to make
I'm just trying to
Find my way
And a face to wear
And a place to be
In the absence of your company.

And I will write you off
Easy as that
If only it was
Easy as that...
