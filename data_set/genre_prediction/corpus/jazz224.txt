
You're gettin in the way of what i'm feelin (x2)

Sista Gurl, I know you don't undastand, 
but you gon' have to undastand he's my man now. 
What you had is gone. Our thing is sweet.
Our thing is stronger than any lie you can tell on me.
He knows my heart. And thats a part.
Ya roots are dug up so you might as well give up.
I see your intentions. You can't handle the truth.
He let you go a long time ago now it's time to turn him loose.

Chorus:
You're gettin in the way of what I'm feelin.
x4

Sugar honey gurl, fly fly away.
I been a lady up until now.
Don't know how much more I can take.
Queens shouldn't swing if you know what I mean.
But I'm bout to take my earrings off give me some vaseline.

(Hook)
I'm bout to go off, in yo face gurl you better chill
(chill and i mean it)
You better back down before you get smack down you better chill
(you betta relax urself

I'm bout to go off, in yo face gurl you better chill
(he's my man gurl, nobody elses)
You better back down before you get smack down you better chill
(you betta back down)

Chorus
x4

You better back down before you get smack down you better chill
(repeat until end of song)

Everything is beautiful between me and him 
and here come you and yo big mouth talkin
about me. Telling him that you seen me up 
24th street with them other cats. But you know
