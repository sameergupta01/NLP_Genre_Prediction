
I'm going to drag you down with me
I'll take you walking by the sea
And when I find a place to rest
I'll hold your head upon my chest
And I 'm going to drag you down with me

Another false alarm
All the kids are fighting round our town

I'm going to crack the goldfish bowl
I want to dance til the milk carts show
And in the crossfire I can see
There is a light that shines on me

I'm going to drag you down with me
Another false alarm
All the kids are fighting round our town 

I'm going to drag you down with me
I 'll take you walking by the sea
I'll deconstruct the sweetest sound 
With godless eyes I 'll watch you drown

I'm going to drag you down with me 
Another false alarm
All the kids are fightng round our town
