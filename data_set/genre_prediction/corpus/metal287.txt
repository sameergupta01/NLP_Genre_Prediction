Lalala...

If paradise is half as nice as heaven that you take me to
Who needs paradise, I'd rather have you

They say paradise is up in the stars
But I needn't sigh because it's so far
'Cause I know it's where a heaven on earth
Will be where you are

A look from your eyes, a touch from your hand
And I seem to fly to some other land
When you are around my heart always pounds
Just like a brass band

If paradise is half as nice as heaven that you take me to
Who needs paradise I'd rather have you
Oh, yes, I'd rather have you
