
If you pray night and day
If you fly all the way
Through the pale gray sky
Listen what I say
Watch the way we reign
As time goes by
Watch it now!
So you see!
Invisible, invincible
Is the force that moves you and me
Worshiped, enthroned
Ruling the world is my way to be
On the top of it all
I'm working my soul
Further up, further down
Further all, all around
Further up, further down
Further all around
Pass on your last love
And follow the line a state is yet unreached
What's under is Above
So now you know the sign prophesized and preached
You know it...O yes you know
Invisible, invincible
Is the force that moves you and me
Worshiped, enthroned
Ruling the world is my way to be
On the top of it all
I'm working my soul
Further up, further down
Further all, all around
Further up, yeah! Further down
Further all around
What's under is Above
Now you know the truth...
