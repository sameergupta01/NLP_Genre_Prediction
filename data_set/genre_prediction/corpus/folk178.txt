
I've been getting down
About all the runaround
About all the questioning
And the standing in the night
But like my friends say
You got to do it anyway
And it just gets harder
When you ask why

And I'm tired from all the weight
Tired of being strong
So won't you come and stay
And let me lay
Down in your arms
Down in your arms

I've been getting up early
I've been getting my coffee
I've been getting in the car and driving
All over town
Talking to myself
While I'm taking off my seatbelt
Some people don't know how to slow down

And I'm tired from all the weight
Tired of being strong
So won't you come and stay
And let me lay
Down in your arms
Down in your arms

I've got a troubled
A troubled mind
And you've got a heart
A heart so kind
So kind

So pack in over night bag
Don't worry about what you have
Cause if you need something
You can just use mine
And you don't have to promise
More than you want to
But if you want to see me
This would be a good time

Cause I'm tired from all the weight
Tired of being strong
So won't you come and stay
And let me lay
Down in your arms
Down in your arms
