
In Norwa there sits a maid

"Byloo, my baby," she begins

"Little know I my child's father

For if land or sea he's living in"

Then there arose at her bed feet

A grumbly guest, I'm sure it was he

Saying, "Here am I, thy child's father

Although that I am not comely

I am a man upon the land

I am a selchie in the sea

And when I am in my own country

My dwelling is in Suleskerry"

Then he had taken a purse of gold

And he hath put it upon her knee

Saying, "Give to me my little wee son

And take thee up thy nurse's fee

It shall come to pass on a summer's day

When the sun shines hot on every stone

That I shall take my little wee son

And teach him for to swim in the foam

You will marry a gunner good

And a proud good gunner I'm sure he will be

But he'll go out on a May morning

And kill both my wee son and me"

Loath she did marry a gunner good

And a proud good gunner, I'm sure it was he

The very first shot that he did shoot

He killed the son and the gray selchie

In Norwa there sits a maid

"Byloo, my baby," she begins

"Little know I my child's father

For if land or sea he's living in"

In Norwa there sits a maid...
