
Outside your window
Rain is pouring down
You know that by tomorrow morning 
There won't be no rain around
Well hushabye my baby
Hushabye my darling child

You can tell
You know darn well
Your daddy wouldn't lie to you

Well if you go to sleep now
Tell you what I'll do
I'll go outside in a midnight sky
And catch a star for you
Well hushabye my baby 
Hushabye my darling child

Cause you can tell
You know darn well
Your daddy wouldn't lie to you

Well in the morning
When you rub your sleepy eyes
We'll go catch us some ol' catfish
Down by the riverside
Hushabye my baby
Hushabye my darling child

Cause you can tell
You know darn well
Your daddy wouldn't lie to you (2x)
