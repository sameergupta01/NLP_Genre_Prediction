
Ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh

If you need me, call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far
Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
On that you can depend and never worry

You see, my love is alive
It's like a seed that only needs
The thought of you to grow
So if you feel the need for company
Please, my darling
Let it be me

Ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh

I may not be able to express
The depth of the love I feel for you
But a writer put it very nicely
When he was away from the one he loved
He sat down and wrote these words

''(No wind)'' No wind
''(No rain)'' No rain
''(Or winter's cold Can stop me baby)'' Ooh baby
''(Baby)'' Baby
''(If you're my goal)'' Oh
''(No wind)'' No wind
''(No rain)'' No rain
''(Can stop me baby)'' If you are my goal

Ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh

I know, I know you must follow the sun
Where ever it leads
But remember, if you should fall short of your desires
Remember life's holds to you one guarantee
You'll always have me

And if you should miss my lovin'
One of these old days
If you should ever miss the arms that used to hold you so close
Or the lips that used to touch yours so tenderly
Just remember what I told you the day I set you free

''(Ain't no mountain high enough)'' Oh
''(Ain't no valley low enough)'' Ooh
''(Ain't no river wide enough)'' Ooh
To keep me from you

''(Ain't no mountain high enough)'' Ow
''(Ain't no valley low enough)'' Say it again
''(Ain't no river wide enough)'' Hey
To keep me from you

Ain't no mountain high enough
Nothing can keep me, keep me from you
Ain't no mountain high enough ''(no)''
Nothing can keep me, keep me from you

Ain't no mountain high enough ''(oh)''
Ain't no valley low enough ''(say it again)''
Ain't no river wide enough ''(yeah yeah)''
To keep me from you

Ain't no mountain high enough
''(Ain't no mountain high enough. Ain't no valley low enough)''
Nothing can keep me, keep me from you
''(Ain't no river wide enough to keep me from you)''

Nothing in this world
''(Ain't no mountain high enough. Ain't no valley low enough)''
Nothing in this world to keep me from you
''(Ain't no river wide enough to keep me from you)''
