
Katie dear make me a road map
That leads to old New York
Katie dear make me a road map
With those brown old eyes I love
And I will sing you a jailbird song 
And all our children will sing along
They'll sing "Louisiana ain't that bad
When all you've had's Louisiana"

Katie dear make me a road map
Of Valley Forge
Katie dear make me a road map
With those brown old eyes I love

And I will sing you a jailbird song 
And all our children will sing along
They'll sing "Louisiana ain't that bad
When all you've had's Louisiana"
