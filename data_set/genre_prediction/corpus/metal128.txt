
it's been a long cold winter
and now it's time for a change
in the season
it's the reason
when we're rolling to the spring
I'm feeling up clouds are moving out
to make way for the sun
brings the people out from in the house
they go have some fun
we love the lazy days
the time to play
together we are one
all the sights and sounds
how we get down
the good times have begun
it's the summer in the city
by the country on the lake
in the mountains and the beaches
chillin' poolside far away

I love the summer
you love summer too
we love the summer
yeah we love the summertime

nothing better than time to chill
spark the bbq - fire up the grill
make sure the cooler is filled for real
than pass me an icecold chill pill, we
call up the family
gather all friends
everyone's invited
so you're welcome to attend
take as much time as I can spend
'cus I never want the summer to end
it's the summer in the city
by the country on the lake
in the mountains and the beaches
chillin' poolside far away

I love the summer
you love summer too
we love the summer
yeah we love the summertime

when it's hot outside and you feel all right
you love it - we love it
on a blue sky day
if you're riding that wave
you love it - we love it!
got the radio on - play your favorite song
you love it - we love it!
hanging out with the friends the party never ends
you love it - we love it!

I love the summer
you love summer too
we love the summer
yeah we love the summertime
