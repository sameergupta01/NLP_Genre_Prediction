I declare I don't care no more
I'm burning up and out and
Growing bored
In my smoked out boring room
My hair is shagging in my eyes
Dragging my feet to hit the
Street tonight
To drive along these shit
Town lights

I'm not growing up, I'm
Just burning out
And i stepped in line to walk amongst the dead

Oh, apathy has rained on me
Now I'm feeling like a
Soggy dream
So close to drowning but
I don't mind
I've lived inside this mental cave
Throw my emotions in the grave
Hell, who needs them
Anyway

I'm not growing up, I'm
Just burning out
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead

I'm not growing up, I'm
Just burning out
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead, dead...

I'm not growing up, I'm
Just burning out
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead

I'm not growing up, I'm
Just burning out
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead, dead...
