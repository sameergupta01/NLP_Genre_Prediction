Forevermore, fucked, strapped to the floor
Headlong while I'm pissing on your floor
Nameless, clueless a brick in the game
Soon to be removed from the face of the Earth

[Bridge]
Is this a human feast?
I was in slumber... now!
Am I to be released?
At least I had a hunger for more!

I'm all the way down in my electric pit
Where all you gimps reign supreme
Where I by your strings are dangling
Twinkle, twinkle, trying to tip-tip-toe

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
Final, fatal, fatal force - feed the flame once more
Final, fatal, fatal force - to get rid of yourself

This final verdict with a diabolical view
Can I ever be free from what is pulling me through Narcissistic, pure electric the savior incarnated

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

So you say I'm just a wicked soul,
well watch me operate!

So you see me coming back for more
You trace my steps like a dog
Nameless, clueless a brick in the game
Soon to be removed from the face of the Earth

[Bridge]
