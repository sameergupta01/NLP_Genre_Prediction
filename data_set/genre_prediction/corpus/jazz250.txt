
I've been workin' on a night train
Drinkin' coffee takin' cocaine
I'm out here on my night train
Tryin' to get us safely home

Well in a little country station
Somewhere out in the midwest
I see the people out there waiting
Heart beating in my chest

And I'm thinking 'bout a woman
Who I put no one above
I'm not lookin' to replace her
Just need someone to love

While I'm out here on my night train
Drinkin' coffee takin' cocaine
I'm out here on my night train
Trying to get her safely home

Well I'm livin' in the city
Where the noise it never stops
Hammers pounding on the pavement
Whitles from traffic cops

Nobody looks you in the eye here
Walkin' 'round with clenched fists
I been searchin' for a simple place
Don't know if it exists

Sunrise out there callin' my name
I can see her movin'
I can see her movin'

Well at a certain time of night now
I become one with the wind
Where there isn't a beginning
And there is no end

Oh and everything is flowing
Everything is on time
I know that we're all going
To the end of the line

And I'm out here on my night train
Drinkin' coffee takin' cocaine
I'm out here on my night train
Trying to get her safely home

Yeah I'm out here on my night train
Drinkin' coffee takin' cocaine
I'm out here on my night train
Trying to get safely home
Trying to get safely home
Trying to get safely home
