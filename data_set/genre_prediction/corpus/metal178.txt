
When you feel safe, when you feel warm
That's when I rise, that's when I crawl
Gliding on mist, hardly a sound
Bringing the kiss, evils abound

In the dead of the night, love bites
Into your room where, in deep sleep
There you lie still, to you I creep
Then I descend, close to your lips

Across you, I bend, you smile as I sip
Now you are mine in my control
One taste of your life
And I own your soul

Softly, you stir, gently, you moan
Lust's in the air, wake as I groan
In the dead of the night, love bites
Love bites you, invites you

To feast in the night
Excites you, delight you
It drains you to white
Love bites

You knew at first sight
You'd enjoy my attack
That with my first bite
There'd be no turning back

So come in my arms, I strike any hour
I will return to trap and devour
In the dead of the night, love bites
