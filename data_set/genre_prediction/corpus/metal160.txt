
Do you remember the time gone
Do you remember tears like golden streaks across the sky
Do you remember, do you believe it's all been said and done
Or is it just beginning, ripping, freezing me
Do you remember the time gone
Or is too painful for you
Do you remember days spent in the sun, the times we shared
It's crystal clear to me, in memory
Maybe I've gone too far, on one of my turns
But no one can take away what I've already learned
Memory lives in shadow, nevermore will I blame
And I swear 'til the end of my days I'll not forget one moment
Burn out the time, burn out the tears, forget who's to blame
Hold out your hand and see through the years
You're just a foolish mortal man
Maybe I've known too long just how abstract we all live
And I've seen how futile anger scars all that we believe
Burn out the time, burn out the tears, forget who's to blame
Hold out your hand and see through the years
You're just a foolish mortal man
And when there's nothing more left to dream
And nowhere left to wander
The memories will be there for you
To give you peace of mind
Maybe I've gone too far, on one of my turns
But no one can take away what I've already learned
Memory lives in shadow, nevermore will I blame
And I swear 'til the end of my life I can't forgive your pain
Burn out the time, burn out the tears, forget who's to blame
Hold out your hand and see through the years
You're just a foolish mortal man
And when there's nothing more left to dream
And nowhere left to wander
The memories will be there for you
To give you peace of mind
And when there's nothing more left to gain
And no risks left worth taking
The memories will be true to you...
In memory, in memory...
Memory is alive
