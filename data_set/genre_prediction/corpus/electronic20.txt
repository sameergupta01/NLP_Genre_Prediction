You're such an inspiration for ways that I will never ever choose to be
Oh so many ways for me to show you how your savior has abandoned you

FUCK YOUR GOD
Your Lord, your Christ
HE DID THIS
Took all you had and
LEFT YOU THIS WAY
Still you pray; never stray; never
TASTE OF THE FRUIT
You never thought to question "Why?"

It's not like you killed someone
It's not like you drove a hateful spear into his side
Praise the one who left you broken down and paralyzed
He did it all for you
He did it all for you

Oh so many many ways for me to show you how your dogma has abandoned you
PRAY
to your Christ, to your God
NEVER TASTE OF THE FRUIT
Never stray; never break; never
CHOKE ON A LIE
Even though he's the one who
DID THIS TO YOU
You never thought to question "Why?"

It's not like you killed someone
It's not like you drove a spiteful spear into his side
Talk to Jesus Christ as if he knows the reasons why
He did it all for you
He did it all for you
He did it all for you
