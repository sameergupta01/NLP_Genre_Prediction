
I must away, love, no longer tarry

This roaring tempest I have to cross

I must be guided without a fall

Into the arms I love the best

When he came to his true love's dwelling

He's knelt down gently upon a stone

Through the window he's whispered soft

"Is my true lover within at home?"

She's raised her up from off her pillow

She's raised her up from off her bed

And through the window she's whispered soft

"Who's that disturbing my own night's rest?"

"Wake up, wake up, love, it's your own true lover

Wake up, wake up, love, and let me in

Oh how the wind blows and how it rains

Oh I am wet, love, unto the skin"

She's raised her up from off her pillow

She's raised her up and let him

They were locked in each other's arms

Until the long night was passed and gone

When the long night was passed and gone

When the dark clouds, they did divide

He's leaned down gently and kissed her soft

He saddled up and away did ride

He's mounted up on his horse and away did ride

He's mounted up on his horse and away did ride
