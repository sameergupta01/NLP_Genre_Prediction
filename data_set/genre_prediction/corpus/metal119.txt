
Oh god I'm sick right to the bone in this hell that I call home,
Boob tube has brought me down, it's worse than it's ever been.
Look what's going on in Los Angeles, violence and social unrest.
And look what happened to New York City, such a shame it's a god damn pity 
It's Like That... 

Used to live my life, blind innocense. Now all I see is mankind's ignorance.
I can't live like this. I can't live like that. It's like that. 

You got a black mark on your face. Paint it.
You dissed the entire human race. Stop it. 

Once you find yourself, you better make it stick.
You don't wanna get pulled down by that racist shit.
Oh no, I can't live like that. 'Cause that life is wack. 

You got a black mark on your face. Paint it.
You dissed the entire human race. Stop it. 

Is this how it's gonna be? From Arizona to NYC?
To me it seems that they can't resist. They walk and like some backwoods hick.
'Cause skin is white, or it's black or it's blue, don't make no difference to me or you.
So give respect to the human race, or Dog Eat Dog will spit in your face punk. 

It's Like That...
