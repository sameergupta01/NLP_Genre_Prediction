
Everyone laughed at her joke
As if they'd never even heard it before
And maybe they were truly amused
But every word that she spoke was a bore
And maybe it's because they had seen
The previews on the TV screen
Well this part is good and that's well understood so you should laugh
If you know what I mean

But its all relative
Even if you don't understand
Well its all understood
Especially when you don't understand
And its all just because
Even if we don't understand
Then let's all just believe

Everyone knows what went down
Because the news was spread all over town
And fact is only what you believe
And fact and fiction work as a team
Its almost always fiction in the end
The content begins to bend
When context is never the same

And its all relative
Even if we don't understand
And its all understood
Especially when we don't understand
And its all just because
Even if we don't understand
Then let's all just believe

I was reading a book
Well, maybe it was a magazine
Suggestions on where to place faith
Suggestions on what to believe
But I read somewhere that you've got to beware
You can't believe anything you read
But the good book is good and that's well understood
So don't even question if you know what I mean

But its all relative
Even if you don't understand
Well its all understood
Especially when you don't understand
Well its all just because
Even if we don't understand
Let's all just believe
But there you go once again you missed the point
And then you point your fingers at me and say that I said not to believe

But there you go once again you missed the point
And then you point your fingers at me and you say that I said not to believe
I believe
But there you go once again you missed the point
And then you point your fingers at me and you say that I said not to believe
I believe...I guess
I guess its all relative
