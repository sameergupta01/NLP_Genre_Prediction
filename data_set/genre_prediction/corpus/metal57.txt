
So this is 
The exemplar death style
You told me about
You want my seed in 
Is this the treason 
I bear the fame from?
My fatal freedom
The omni swan song

I carry the news of darkness and hope

So this is
The underworld
You have in your heart
You hide in your room
I'm so sorry to say
It only makes me laugh

I carry the news of darkness and hope

So here I have your act of love
Within the poison of your every word
Each night you stay in, each night I will have to run
Knowing from darkness and hope
There is no return

I carry the news of darkness and hope

Dedicated to the small great people of 
Saboia, Alentejo, Portugal
Hang, rope, silver bullet, magic pill
Mandrake's root, the southern death style
