
If I had to do it over
If I had to do it again
I would've know to, yeah
This would've never began

If I made you claustrophobic
Imagine if I gave you an inch
You'll never notice
But there's NoOne quite like
NoOne quite like you

I try to forget you
But you're all I wanna do
I could do better
But there's NoOne quite like
Noone quite like you

I try to forget you
But you're all I wanna do
I could do better
There's NoOne quite like
NoOne quite like you

If I made you love me again
If I made you want me again
If I gave it you probably wouldn't want it babe
It's all-right 'cause there's
NoOne quite like you

I try to forget you
But you're all I wanna do
I could do better
There's NoOne quite like
NoOne quite like you
