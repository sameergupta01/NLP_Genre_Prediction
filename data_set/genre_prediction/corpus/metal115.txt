
Too many people are talking shit,
Too many people are telling lies,
Nobody ever wants to give an inch,
Nobody ever wants to sacrifice. 

Sacrifice, pay the price, understand you gotta lend a hand.
Respect the man, live your life like a f**king man. 

You walk the globe acting like a fool,
But what you're doing comes back to you.
Just remember rule number one
When you're a dick, you'll be treated like a dick. 

A dick, a cock, a piece of shit,
'Cause karma has everything to do with it.
It's not where you're going, it's where you've been,
It's not what you're doing, it's what you've done. 

That's right, you'll never be the little one,
Never give in and never say you're done. 

Nobody ever wants to sacrifice
Nobody ever gonna pay the price.
Nobody ever gonna understand,
Nobody ever gonna lend a hand.
When ya listen to the lyrics it's a conscience song,
School your differences on right and wrong.
You teach, you learn, you gain insight
I'll show you the difference between wrong and right. 

One is wrong, and one is right
