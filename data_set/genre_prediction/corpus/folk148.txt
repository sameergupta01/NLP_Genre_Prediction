
Well, a plowman dresses fine, he drinks strong ale and wine

And the best of tobacco he does smoke

Pretty maids don't think amiss a plowman for to kiss

For his breath is as sweet as the rose, the rose

For his breath is as sweet as the rose

Well, a plowman in his shirt completely does his work

And so loudly to the little boy does call

Saying, "Be nimble and be quick with the swishing of your stick"

And so merrily he rattles them along, along

And do merrily he rattles them along

When our shears are shod, to the blacksmith off we trod

And so loudly to the blacksmith we do call

Saying, "Be nimble and be quick, throw your blows in thick"

And so merrily he'll swing his hammer 'round, around

And so merrily he'll swing his hammer 'round

When our shears are done, to the alehouse we do run

And so loudly to the landlord we do call

Saying, "Bring to us some beer, for while I am here"

A plowman is always running dry, dry

A plowman is always running dry
