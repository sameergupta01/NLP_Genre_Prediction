
Even if I'm sick in bed with a towel around my head
Even if I'm feeling blue and crying is all I do
I know she'll be there beside of me
Lady Day, please wont you stay, my Lady Day

Even if the sea does rise and there's waves up to the skies
And the evening bells wont ring no matter how you pull the thing
I know she'll find some way to soothe my mind
Lady Day, please wont you stay, my Lady Day

Even if the nightbird sings some foul and tempered thing
And it wakes me from a dream of booze and nicotine
I know she'll be there beside of me
Lady Day, please wont you stay, my Lady Day

Even if the world turns white and the night turns into night
And there's rebels on the beach exchanging weapons each to each
I know she'll find some way to soothe my mind
Lady Day, please won't you stay, my Lady Day

Even if I get sick as hell and I never do get well
And at last my heart does fail and to some golden city sail
I won't much care to love no angel there
Lady Day, please wont you stay, my Lady Day
