
[Music: Bart, Lyrics: Sven/Joel]

Taking advantage of the mentally instable,
I shall deprive of life and vision
All goals are clear to me, building an empire based on lies
I unleash upon others.

Indoctrination-feeding incapables with ridicule proclamations,
psychic eradication, numbing common sense to enslave the mass

Like a vulture, a psychological predator,
I swarm around and feed upon their hate
A deliberate lobotomy, engrained mentally
They are nothing but tools to bereave life

Dare forsake me, dare doubt me
For I am god, plead for my mercy
Dare forsake me, dare doubt me
Face my wrath, as I strike
An unholy act is this arrest
Like a plague on man life ends

Indoctrination-feeding incapables with ridicule proclamations,
psychic eradication, numbing common sense to enslave the mass

idiots who are too stupid to live have done my bidding
psychic traumas caused in the name of god,
For i am David and David is He.
