
This necrotic usurper
Traceless in its shroud
Enslaving souls
In need of satisfaction
Raving souls to fill the motherfucking hole

Feed and fortify
The parasitic loyalty
Manipulate, mortify and maim

Join the lack of anything
Take part in this vacuum
Become a sack of flesh
To share a truly rare state of mind

Under the command
The most impotent avenious
Deluded by reality
To share a truly rare state of mind
Stare blind

The smoke and mirrors
The glance and glitter
The grin of the sickened urge for near-life
A shade of mutualism
Cast on a treacherous bond
Trust is the drug
The barren common ground
Beyond What is represented
As your own choice
As you are caught

Feed and fortify
The parasitic loyalty
Manipulate, mortify and maim

This is not the first nor the last
A useful exercise...
Different perspectives to reality
My methods of malice and scorn are revealed

Employed in dramatic performance of virtue to symbolize
The perfect balance between good taste, pain and suffering

Your true face exposed

Behind your mask, behind the farce, you still hide
Behind your mask, nameless coward
Behind your mask, the face behind the face
Finally exposed, useless puppets, now step forth

Join lack of anything
Take part in this vacuum
Become a sack of flesh
To share a truly rare state of mind

The smoke and mirrors
The glance and glitter
The grin of the sickened urge for a near-life
A shade of mutualism
Cast on a treacherous bond
Trust is the drug
The barren common ground
Beyond What is represented
As your own choice
As you are caught

Feed and fortify
The parasitic loyalty
Manipulate, mortify and maim
