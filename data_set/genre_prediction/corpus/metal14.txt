[Music: Christophe, Lyrics: Sven]

Murder
I have been embraced by suffering,
No longer human, I stalk my prey
To kill and gut all surrounding me
Humanity in me slips away

Into the basement,
My own private morgue
Necrotic restants are left to devour
Lunacy errupts from the world you breed
Nothing survives as I consume my meat

Depraved in my sea of cartilage
I'm draved in gore

I have been embraced by suffering,
No longer human, I stalk my prey
To kill and gut all surrounding me
My humanity slips from me

Into the basement,
My own private morgue
Necrotic restants are left to devour
Lunacy errupts from the world you breed
Nothing survives as I consume my meat

Severed head as ornament
My collection of the dead
Punctured cranial-walls collapse
Filled with acid
My aphrodisiac...

I will not rest...
Until I've killed you all
I will not rest...

Until your head
Hangs on the wall of suffering
No longer human, it takes control
Feelings overwhealming me
I have to rid the earth
Of human anatomy

I will not rest, until i've killed you all
Exposed and gutted in my hall of gore
Murder the world... let the blood run... free...

Infected, by this disease called love
I must fill my private morgue
Dissecting randomly,
Your voluptuous cadaver into soup I'll render

Can no longer bear this suffering
I am your god, your tortured will
No longer human it takes control
Destined to torture, mutilate and destroy
