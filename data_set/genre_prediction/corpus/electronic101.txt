With you in my garden
its more peaceful inside
I don't need anything else
to make me feel alive

You electrify me
And I want to be in your arms
for always
for always

Our love is swollen
Made of the quietest shade of loud
Holds me like an anchor
Floats just like a cloud

Our love is swollen
Made of the quietest shade of loud
Holds me like an anchor
Floats just like a cloud

Our love is swollen
Made of the quietest shade of loud
Holds me like an anchor
