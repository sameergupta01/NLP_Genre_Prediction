
Girl I'm in love with you
But this ain't the honeymoon
We're past the infatuation phase
Right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue everyday

I know I misbehaved
And you made your mistakes
And we both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow

Take it slow, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, this time we'll take it slow

This ain't a movie no
No fairytale conclusion y'all
It gets more confusing every day
Sometimes it's heaven sent,
Then we head back to hell again
We kiss then we make up on the way

I hang up, you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walking away
But as our love advances
We take second chances
Tho' it's not a fantasy 
I still want you to stay

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow

Take it slow, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, this time we'll take it slow

Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay 
Maybe you'll leave
Maybe you'll return
Maybe you'll never find
Maybe you won't survive
But maybe we'll grow
We'll never know
Baby you and I 

We're just ordinary people...
