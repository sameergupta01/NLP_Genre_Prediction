
I'm not gonna fall down today,
Instead I will buckle my knees and sway
Against sweet memories
Against memories

I've gotta get outta here today, today
There is too much room in this bed where I lay
The street buzzes for me, below, buzzes for me

And if the breeze blows me down
I'll take my time to come around,
But I'm not out, oh, I'm not out

Wish I could pull you down today,
From that storm high up that's taking you away
What would you say to me?
What would you say to me?

And if the breeze blows me down
I'll take my time to come around,
But I'm not out, oh, I'm not out

And I'm sure that I am tangled up in things you said out loud to me
So recklessly,
And it's easier to sing the things I wanna say to you,
So I'll sing, you're losing me my love,
You're losing me my love,
Are you losing me my love?
