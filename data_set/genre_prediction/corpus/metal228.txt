can you give as much as you can take
can you love as much as you can hate
the flame we share is one as you're aware
the needs we burn is the child we never had
we split our lives to find our mind again
we do divorce so our first fight's regained
together will we remain to say

together we will live, this century got so much more to give
together we will leave, giving to the world a better place to grow

feelings we keep away from decay
feelings we send each other everyday
does your silence speak the word I hear
does your reserve mean what I fear
the forever we are is the forever we murdered
stay right here, stand by me

together we will live, this century got so much more to give
together we will leave, giving to the world a better place to grow
together we will live, this century got so much more to give
together we will leave, giving to the world a better place to grow

together will we remain to say
together will we survive to see
