
[Lyrics by Sven]

Recline and behold, a sorbid display
Absorb and digest, the most nauseating of all
Novellas ever told

So Incompetent, yet urged to implement
Despite the lack of operative skills,
His lacunal medical content
A raging disgust to populace portent
So incompetent yet urged to operate

Inflicting cessation - upon a world that's left to rot
Genocidal perfection - procreating necrosis on a global scale
Inflicting cessation - upon a world dying to end
Genocidal profection - from dusk till dawn to end

Recline and behold,
Forever - prophecies foretold
In my eyes - merely a function to uphold

I cannot see why anyone would regret
The extermination of this rock of filth
Humanitary suffocates,
Humanity hates
Industrial channels conform the abolition on organic integrity

Forever - prophecies foretold
In my eyes - merely a function to uphold
Forever - prophecies foretold
In my eyes - merely a function to uphold

So Incompetent, yet urged implement
Despite the lack of operative skills,
His lacunal medical content from dusk till dawn to end

Ingenuity In Genocide...

Inflicting cessation - upon a world that's left to rot
Genocidal perfection - procreating necrosis on a global scale
Inflicting cessation - upon a world dying to end
Genocidal profection - from dusk till dawn to end

I cannot see why anyone would regret
The extermination of this rock of filth
Humanity suffocates,
Humanity hates
Industrial channels conform
The abolition of organic integrity

Absorb and digest, the most nauseating of all
Novellas ever told
