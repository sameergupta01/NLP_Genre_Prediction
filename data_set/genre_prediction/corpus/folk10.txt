I find myself more and more mistaking
myself for someone else

Hey, my love, I came to you with best intentions
You laid down and gave to me just what I'm seeking
Say, love, you drive me to distraction

Oh my love you believe that we might last a thousand years
Or more if not for this,
Our flesh and blood
It ties you and me right up
Tie me down, ah well,

Celebrate ah
Celebrate we will
Cause life is short but sweet for certain
We climb on two by two
To be sure these days continue
Things we cannot change

Hey, my love, you came to me like wine comes to this mouth
Grown tired of water all the time
You quench my heart and, love, you quench my mind and say:

Let's celebrate ah
Celebrate we will
'Cause life is short but
Sweet for certain
We climb on two by two
To be sure these days continue
Things we cannot oh not today
Celebrate ah
Celebrate we will, you and me
Climb on two by two, to be sure
These days continue
Things we cannot change

Hey my love, I came to you
With best intentions
You, you laid down and gave to me
Just what I'm seeking
Say, love, won't you come celebrate...
Celebrate we will
'Cause life is short
But sweet for certain
We climb on two by two
To be sure these days continue
Things we cannot change...
Things we cannot change.
