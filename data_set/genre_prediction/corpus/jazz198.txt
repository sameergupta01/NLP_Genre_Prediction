
Santa
Baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me 
I've been an awful good girl 
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight 

Santa baby, a 54 convertible too, light blue

I'll wait up for you dear 
Santa baby, so hurry
Down the chimney tonight 

Think of all
The fun I've missed 
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed 
Next year I could be just as good 
If you'd check off my Christmas list 

Santa
Baby, I wanna yacht and really that's not a lot 
I've been an angel all year 
Santa baby, so hurry
Down the chimney tonight 

Santa baby,
There's something I really do need, the deed 
To a platinum mine 
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney
Tonight 

Santa baby, I'm filling my stocking
With a duplex, and checks 
Sign your 'X' on the line 
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight 

Come and trim my Christmas tree 
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's 

I really do believe in you 
Let's see if you believe in me 

Santa baby,
Forgot to mention one little thing, a ring 
I don't mean on the phone 
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney
Tonight 

Santa baby, hurry
Down the chimney tonight 
Santa baby, hurry down the
Chimney tonight 
Santa Baby, hurry tonight
