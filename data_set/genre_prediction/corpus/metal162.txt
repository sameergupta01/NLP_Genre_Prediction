
Take me away to the quiet place
Where the doors of perception open wide
Smiling faces greet me there
Loved and lost, lost inside

Take me away to the netherworld
Where we dance in the waves, the universe shines
The place that holds my beautiful dream
When I awake, I look to the sky and

Pray that I will live forever
The sorrow man will not be me
Today I'll change my life forever
For what I've seen must surely be

Fly me away on the wings of a dove
To the temple of knowledge we can fly
Smiling inside, peace so clear
One with the all, one within mind

Fly me away to a better world
Where there's no more war and can be no shame
The place that holds the great mystery
When I awake, I look to the sky and

Pray that I will live forever
The sorrow man will not be me
Today I'll change my life forever
For what I've seen must surely be

Here I am, body and soul
Flesh and blood, on this stage I play my role
No, there's no time left for gazing at the sky
No, there's no time left, kiss the wind goodbye and
Pray that I will live forever

The sorrow man will not be me
Today I'll change my life forever
For what I've seen must surely be
In the eyes of the sorrowed man...
