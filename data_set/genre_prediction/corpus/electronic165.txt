i remember watching you go
and the long walk home
past the blinking lights of the strip clubs and the carl's jr.

and i remember brushing your hand
and how it made me feel so sad
i wanted to hold your hand so bad

and this is the bus that will take you away
i hope you enjoyed your stay
it wouldn't have worked anyway

this is the bus that will take you away
i hope you enjoyed your stay
wouldn't have worked anyway
this is the bus that will take you away
i hope you enjoyed your stay
wouldn't have worked anyway

i should've kissed you when i had the chance
