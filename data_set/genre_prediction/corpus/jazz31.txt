Raindrops on roses

And whiskers on kittens

Bright copper kettles

And warm woolen mittens

Brown paper packages tied up with strings

These are a few of my favorite things



Cream colored ponies

And crisp apple strudels

Door bells and sleigh bells

And shnitzel with noddles

Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings

These are a few of my favorite things



Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes

Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes

Silver white winters and melt into springs

These are a few of my favorite things



When the dog bites

When the bee stings

When I'm feeling sad

I simply remember my favorites things

And then I don't feel so bad
