My dearest son it's almost June,
I hope this letter catches up with you
and finds you well.
It's been dry but they're callin for rain,
and every thing is the same ol' same in Johnsonville.
Your stubburn old daddy ain't said too much,
but I'm sure you know he sends his love.
And she goes on in a letter from home

CHORUS

I hold it up and show my buddies,
like we aint scared and our boots ain't muddy.
And they all laugh
like there's somethin' funny
'bout the way I talk when I say
&amp;amp;quot;Mamma sends her best ya'll.&amp;amp;quot;
I fold it up and put it in my shirt,
pick up my gun and get back to work.
And it keeps me drivin' on...
waitin' on
letters from home.

My dearest love it's almost dawn,
I've been layin' here all night long
wonderin' where you might be.
I saw your Mamma and I showed her the ring
Man on the television said something
so I couldn't sleep.
But I'll be all right, I'm just missin' you,
and this is me kissin' you...
X's and O's
in a letter from home.

I hold it up and show my buddies,
like we ain't scared and our boots ain't muddy.
And they all laugh cause she calls me honey
but they take it hard
cause I don't read the good parts.
I fold up and put it in my shirt,
pick up my gun and get back to work.
And it keeps me drivin' on...
waitin' on
letters from home.

Dear son, I know I ain't written,
but sittin' here tonight alone in the kitchen, it occurs to me...
I might not have said it so I'll say it now,
&amp;amp;quot;Son, you make me proud.&amp;amp;quot;

I hold it up and show my buddies,
like we aint scared and our boots aint muddy.
But no one laughs,
'cause there aint nothin' funny
when a soldier cries...
And I just wipe my eyes.
I fold it up and put it in my shirt,
pick up my gun and get back to work.
And it keeps me drivin' on...
waitin' on,
letters from home.
