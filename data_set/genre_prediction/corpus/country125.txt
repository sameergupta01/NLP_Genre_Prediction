

I found a book on how to be invisible 
Take a pinch of keyhole 
And fold yourself up 
You cut along a dotted line 
You think inside out 
And you’re invisible 

Eye of Braille 
Hem of anorak 
Stem of wallflower 
Hair of doormat 

I found a book on how to be invisible 
On the edge of the labyrinth 
Under a veil you must never lift 
Pages that you must never turn 
In the labyrinth 
You stand in front of a million doors 
And each one holds a million more 
Corridors that lead to the world 
Of the invisible 
Corridors that twist and turn 
Corridors that blister and burn 

Eye of Braille 
Hem of anorak 
Stem of wallflower 
Hair of doormat 
Is that the wind from the desert song? 
Is that the autumn leaf falling? 
Or is that you walking home? 

Is that the wind from the desert song? 
Is that the autumn leaf falling? 
Or is that you walking home? 
Is that a storm in the swimming pool? 

You take a pinch of keyhole 
And fold yourself up 
You cut along a dotted line 
You think inside out 
You jump ’round three times 
You jump into the mirror 
And you’re invisible
