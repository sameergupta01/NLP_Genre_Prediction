

On June fifth, in the year of eighty-nine
He was unarmed with focused mind
Deflance glared down the barrel of the gun
Pointed from a tank in Tiananmen Square

And he stood there to control, to manipulate
The media his power slave
He knew the world was watching
Knew he had a plan
To confront the powerful tyranny in the square of Tiananmen

Ecstatic youth played with fire
Freedom wash over them
Democracy their desire
The Tiananmen man had a plan
Manipulate the media

He used blind faith in the face of anarchy
The cybernetic rapture has begun to envelop me

Freedom is the rush
Adrenaline high
Choice of the oppressed, wiling to die
Like a hostage, the government holds your drug

To control, to manipulate
The media his power slave
He knew the world was watching
Knew he had a plan
To confront the powerful tyranny in the square of Tiananmen

Ecstatic youth played with fire
Freedom wash over them
Democracy their desire
The Tiananmen man had a plan
Manipulate the media

His act was a cybernetic gesture
His act was a cybernetic gesture
He knew the world was watching
Knew he had a plan
To confront the powerful tyranny in the square of Tiananmen

Ecstatic youth played with fire
Freedom wash over them
Democracy their desire
The Tiananmen man had a plan
Manipulate the media
manipulate the media
Manipulate to control
