What could one possibly say
To someone who ignores his way
Who's never been touched by grace

How could one eventually express
All the tension, all the stress
That can't be read on his face

All the people that one met
All the people that one left
They enrich, they develop
What one's got to reach the top

Being a sum of experiences
Giving life the consistence
Knowing details makes differences
Entering a heart of existence

Tune your mind to the right channel
Things get played at a higher scale
Go memorize the frequency

Isn't it phenomenal
Don't you think it's magical
The electric storm of ecstasy

Ride the wind, take on your destiny
You gotta get much higher
Fly your flight, get over society
The world is far much bigger

Nothing is impossible
Nothing is unreachable

Tune your mind to the right channel
Things get played at a higher scale
Go memorize the frequency

Isn't it phenomenal
Don't you think it's magical
This electric storm of ecstasy

Fear's got no place around here
What we see, what we hear
Format our comprehension

The un-thought, things we ignore
All the pulses and all the more
Wait to reach our perception

Spread your consistence to other territory
Your vision's gonna get much clearer
When the hunt is over parts meet in sympathy
World peace is getting nearer...
