

Hypnotize me; mesmerize me
Drain the color from my eyes
Patronize me; energize me
Change the world, internalize

How did it come to this?
Narcosynthesis

Alienate me; learn to hate me
Crucify your ideals; the flesh is the swine
We are the last ones, and we're bleeding
For an unseen god

How did it come to this?
Narcosynthesis

Turn my blood to sand
Lives fall through the hourglass and grow cold
What are you searching for?

Turn my dirt to gold
Time, the healer; the great concealer
Please salvage my soul

Victimize me; vilify me
Vilipend and amend the sins you condign

You are nothing and you speak for
All that never was
