The gentleman caller in the blue suede shoes
He don't know what to do
He just wants to look good for you
So he rushes in to tell you what he did today
But he can't think of what to say
I think you listen anyway.

He wants to have a good time
Just like everybody
He doesn't want to fall apart

You watch him as he stutters over what to say
It's just a little game you play
It's no easier for you some days
You wish you could tell him it'll be okay
But you feel a little shy these days
Cause everybody goes away

Oh...
You just want to have a good time
Just like everybody else
You don't want to fall apart this time

I can look into your eyes and see the
Mess we're in
Well darling, if it's shit came out
Then I suppose that it's shit went in
Even though I couldn't say I've been the
Places that you've been
You know he made my heart real strong
Even if he made my head real thin

I just want to have a good time
Just like everybody
And I don't want to fall apart

I just want to have a good time
Just like everybody else
And I don't want to fall apart this time
So would you please invite me in

I really love the red haired girls
I'm just another boy from Texas
C'mon and take a spin
Oh, I got a brand new set of wings

Oh,
I really really love the red haired girls
I'm just another boy from Texas
C'mon and take a spin
Hey
I gotta brand new set of wings

Man I sure do love them red haired girls
I'm just like all the boys from Texas
Come on take a spin
Hey little girl I got a brand new set of wings
