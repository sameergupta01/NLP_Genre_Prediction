
Yeah. Yeah.
Ooh, Ooh, Ohh

If you see me walking down the street
Or in the pages of your magzine
Looking just a little differently
Showing off a softer side of me

They saying I'm looking like a lady
They saying that love is going to change me
But don't be fooled by everything you see
Gotta let the naughty in me free

There's a woman inside of all of us
Who never quite seems to get enough
Trying to play by the rules is rough
Cause sooner or later something's going to erupt

Cause I still got that nasty in me
Still got that dirrty degree (still got it)
And if you want some more sexy
Still got that freak in me
I still got that nasty in me
Still got that dirrty degree (oh yeah)
And if you want some more sexy
Still got that freak in me

No matter what you thinking of me, still dirrty
And if you're still rolling with me, still got it
No matter what you thinking of me, still dirrty
Still got that freak in me

Why is a woman's sexuality
Always under so much scrutiny?
Why can't she do exactly as she please
Without being called a million things?

They say I'm not the girl they used to know (used to know)
'Cause I don't always wear revealing clothes (oh)
But don't be fooled the moment I get home (I get home)
I'm letting loose givin' a private show (don't you know)

There's some women out there who talk and stare
Who never seem to let down their hair
Like to past judgement, but they're just scared
And don't know what they're missing, so they better beware

'Cause I still got that nasty in me
Still got that dirrty degree (ooh)
And if you want some more sexy
Still got that freak in me
I still got that nasty in me
Still got that dirrty degree (oh yeah)
And if you want some more sexy
Still got that freak in me (oh yeah)

No matter what you thinking of me, still dirrty
And if you're still rolling with me, still got it
No matter what you thinking of me, still dirrty
Still got that freak in me

Don't tell me to behave
'Cause I'll never play that game (no)
Don't tell me what to do
'Cause I'll never be uptight like you
Don't look at me that way
'Cause I ain't never gonna change
And if you're talking about my life
You're only wasting your own time

If I want to wear lingere outside of my clothes
If I want to be erotic in my own videos
If I want to be provacative, well that ain't a sin
Maybe you're not comfortable in your own skin

I still got that nasty in me
Still got that dirrty degree (in me)
And if you still want some more sexy
Still got that freak in me
I still got that nasty in me
Still got that dirrty degree (in me)
And if you still want some more sexy
Still got freak in me

Ooh, yeah.
Hey, hey, hey.
Ohh. Ohh. Ohh. Ohh.
