

Into a strange new world
Into the after all, your tears
Might find you've fallen too far 
Take another look
Take another ride 
Can't we make them leave the hate behind 

And I still believe in nothing 
Will we ever see the shape of tomorrow? 

Into the empty storm
Into the formless loss of hope
Where we can forget the game 
And I still believe in nothing 
Will we ever see the cure for our sorrow? 

Nothing is sacred when no one is saved 
Nothing's forever, so count your days 
Nothing is final and no-one is real 
Pray for tomorrow and find you're empty still 

Nothing is sacred when no one is saved 
Nothing's forever, so count your days 
Nothing is final and no-one is real 
Pray for tomorrow and find you're empty

Nothing is sacred when no one is saved 
Nothing's forever, so count your days 

Nothing!
