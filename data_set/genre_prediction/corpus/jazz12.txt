Ring The Bells

Ring, ring the bells
Wake the town, everyone is sleeping
Shout at the crowd, wake them up
this anger's deeper than the sea

Chorus
Got to keep awake to what is happening
I don't see a thing thru my ambition
I no longer feel my god is watching over me
Got to tell the world we've all been dreaming
This is not the end, a new begining
I no longer feel my god is watching over me

Break, break the code
Concentrate, let the doors swing open
See through all your walls, all your floors
Now you're as deep as the sea

Chorus

When you let me fall, grew my own wings
Now I'm as tall as the sky
When you let me drown, grew gills and fins
Now I'm as deep as the sea
When you let me die, my spirit's free
There's nothing challenging me

Ooooh...
