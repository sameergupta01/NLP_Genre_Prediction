
I'm all packed up now early in the morning
I'll take my leave
I'll bring your words along with me
Maybe one day they will mean something

For now they buzz and crumble down
A little bit too easily
From a time that I am not quite over
What the hell is wrong with me?

I might be gone a little while
I guess we'll see
I gotta make a home outta somewhere
And you're all over this city

And it'll take a flight to figure out
Where I'm gonna finally land
And the time it takes for me get there
I'll be one to start again

But I should probably say that I'm unsure why I'm running
Running away from the only thing I want
Yeah, I should probably say that I'm unsure why I'm running
Running away from the one I love

And if the plane lifts off
I'll write you a letter to say goodbye
And I will make it long and maybe lie just a little
Tell you that I'm doing fine

Then I'll send it out and let things be
If not for you
For me and for the time I've spent
Foolishly loving thee

But I should probably say that I'm unsure why I'm running
Running away from the only thing I want
Yeah, I should probably say that I'm unsure why I'm running
Running away from the one I love
The one I love
