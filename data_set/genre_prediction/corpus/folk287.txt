
Show me mercy
Show me mercy, Mary girl
Bury this here gun and play my widow
In the kitchen window
In the last of the falling sun

Show me mercy
Won't you nurse these wounds of mine
Rinse and sew me up
Baby your eyes are like a pale blue Chrysler
Drive us to the sun

Sure am thirsty
Show me mercy, Molly girl
Lift your pitcher to my mouth
Close your eyelids in the smoky silence
With your black hair falling down

Show me mercy
Show me mercy, Mary girl
Bury this here gun
With Jesus laughing, now you see what happens
When devils fall in love

Show me mercy
Smokestack curse the churchyard air
Where a virgin weeps for us
With Jesus laughing in the breezy blackness
Where devils fall in love
