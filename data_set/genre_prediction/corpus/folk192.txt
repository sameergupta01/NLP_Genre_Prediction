

You know the year of 1900 
That was sixty years ago 
Death come howling on the ocean 
Death calls, you got to go 
Now Galveston had a seawall 
To keep the water down 
But high tide from the ocean 
Spread the water over the town 

(Chorus:)
Wasn't that a mighty storm 
Ya an' that a mighty storm in the morning 
Wasn't that a mighty storm
Now it blew all the people all away 

You know the trumpets give them warning 
Said you'd better leave this place 
Woah, no one thought of leaving 
'til death stared them in the face 
Then the trains at the station were loadin' 
All the people leaving town 
An' the trestle give way without warning 
The train they went on down 

(Chorus) 

Ya, the rain it was a' falling 
Thunder began to roll 
Lightning flashed like hell fire 
Yes, the wind began to blow 
And it's death the cruel master 
When the wind began to blow 
Rode in on a team of horses 
Cried, "Death, won't you let me go". 

(Chorus) 

You know trees fell on the island 
And the houses give away 
Some they strained and drowned 
Some died in most every way 
And the sea began to rolling 
Mean'd the ships they could not land 
And I heard a captain crying 
"God save the drowning man". 

(Chorus) 

Ah, the death your hands are clammy 
You got them on my knee 
You come and took my mother 
Won't you come back after me 
And the flood it took my neighbor 
An' it took my brother too 
I thought I heard my father call... 
I watched my mother go 

(Chorus) 

You know the year of 1900 
Children, sixty years ago 
Death come howling on the ocean 
Death calls, you got to go 

(Chorus 2X)
