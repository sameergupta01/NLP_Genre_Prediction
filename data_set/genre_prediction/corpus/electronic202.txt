I aint got no fire, hide my cigarette
I am just an old dog
Looking for my midnight pet
She hangs on so bad
Sticking all those who do lie
I take a drink and blow smoke right in her eyes
Blow smoke right in her eyes

Poor doggie, where's your bone?

You sure aint an old dog
You did learn some tricks
Show me you're a good dog
Show me you can beg
Maybe if you're real good
I'll give you just a treat
Show me desperation, there's other dogs to beat
There's other dogs to beat

Poor doggie where's your bone?

Your leash is a short one
Roll over and play dead
You're my pretty doggie
I pet you on your head
Oh you feel so good
You sure do make me proud
I won't touch you up but I will put you down
I will put you down
There's other dogs to beat
