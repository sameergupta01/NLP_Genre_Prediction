I heard her in the valley,
I heard her in the dead of night.
The warning of a white hare
Her eyes burning bright.

Be careful you don`t catch her
Or give her right of way.
For she will look upon you,
And steal your soul away

For the white hare is calling,
She's dancing in the night.
She'll be out `til the morning light.

Out upon the heather
A shadow came onto me.
Her hair was hanging over,
Her face I could not see.

She ran behind the rocks,
I heard the hounds cry,
The image of a woman
With head she held up high.

For the white hare is calling,
She’s dancing in the night.
She'll be out `til the morning
With her eyes burning bright.
The white hare is calling you.

If you go hunting,
Calling out your prey,
If you see a fair maid,
Her hair of ash and grey,

Careful you don`t catch her,
Or give her right of way,
For she will look upon you,
And steal your soul away

For the white hare is calling,
She's dancing in the night.
She'll be out `til the morning,
With her eyes burning bright.
The white hare is calling you.

You can her her calling every night

You can her her calling every night
You can her her calling……
