
Ear to the ground keep one eye on the clock
The crew that's rising up this time
ain't the N.K.O.T.B.
Don't wanna take a number 
not gonna stand in line
Think we're buying all the bullshit
well your're out your fuckin' mind
I only see in front of me
Will you watch my back?
Searching for the guidance such a long time we have lacked
Land of equality who is number one?

What comes around
goes around hard
What goes around's comin' up harder

Open your mind now hear what I've got to say
People livin' off the streets growing by the day
Speaking on the numbers I look out for number one
Politics can't fix this mess could a revolution?

I only see in front of me could you watch my back?
These be the times when truth is crime and lie is fact
People runnin' game to make a name this one weighs a ton

What comes around
goes around hard
What goes around's comin' up harder
