Whenever dark has fallen
you know the spirit of the party
starts to come alive.
Until the day is dawning
you can throw out all your blues
and hit the city lights.

(1st chorus)

'Cause there's music in the air
and lots of loving everywhere
so give me the night, give me the night.

You need the evening action
a place to dine, a glass of wine
a little late romance.
It's a chain reaction.
You'll see the people of the world
coming out to dance.

(1st Chorus)

(2nd Chorus)

So come on out tonight
and we'll lead the others
on a ride through paradise.
And if you feel alright
then we can be lovers 'cause i see that
starlight look in your eyes.
Don't you know we can fly?
Just give me the night, give me the night.

(Repeat 1st Chorus)

(Repeat 2nd Chorus)

And if we stay together
we'll feel the rhythm of the evening
taking us up high.
Never mind the weather.
We'll be dancing in the street
until the morning light.
