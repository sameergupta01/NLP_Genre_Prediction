
VERSE # 1
Early morning, I got Mona Lisa by my side
What's the story, behind that devious smile?
Do do do do ….

VERSE # 2
She's an angel NAH she's the monkey on my back
She HAS freedom, still she never let's me go now

And my blood starts PUMPIN'
And my heart goes JUMPIN'
Every time she SAYS I HAVE TO GO NOW
But it really don't matter
For worse or for better
She will always be my number one

CHORUS
Do do do do … My heart goes BANG BANG BOOM
Do do do do … When she walks into the room
Do do do do … My heart goes BANG BANG BOOM

VERSE #3
She supplies me, whenever ever I'm in need
Still a thief, from the day she stole my heart now

CHORUS 

BRIDGE

When she walks into the room
She makes me touch the sky
A devil in disguise
She makes me touch the sky
An angel in disguise

Mona Lisa by my side
With that devious ole smile
She's a devil in disguise
Still she makes me touch the sky
She supplies me when I need
Stole my heart and made me bleed
Well I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind
When she goes

CHORUS (repeat)
