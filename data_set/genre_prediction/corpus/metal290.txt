You're all I've known, all I adore
You take all my scars and break my heart

And I can never look back there again
This is the last time you try to justify
For all the reasons you'd sell me out

You're all my heart, my flesh and blood
Night's so lonely without you around me

And I can never look back there again
This is the last time you try to justify
For all the reasons you'd sell me out

I will be your garden plant, your bones
I will be your sovereign kingdom...

This is the last time you try to justify
For all the reasons you'd sell me out
This is the last time you try to ease my mind
For all the reasons you'd sell me out
