Been gone - so long, I can?t wait to get back home
Home to the Lone Star State, another day I just can?t wait
Look out boys, I?m a-headed your way
I got a mind that wonders in a ?57 Chevrolet
Hold on tight, I got a licence to fly
With the pedal to the metal watch me roll on by

Wanna boogie back to Texas ? boogie back to Texas
Boogie back to Texas ? boogie back to Texas
We?re gonna boogie back to Texas, eight beats to the mile

Rollin? out-a New York, philadelphia
Pittsburg wheelin?, West-Virginia all the way
I?m gonna make it to Kentucky
Gonna make it by the mornin? If I?m fast an? if I?m lucky
Hold on tight, I?m a-homeward bound
Gonna boogie back to Austin, back to my hometown

Boogie back to Texas ? boogie back to Texas
Boogie back to Texas ? boogie back to Texas
We?re gonna boogie back to Texas, eight beats to the mile

Well, state line slammin? me
Oklahoma city?s just a memory
Forth Worth, Dallas, I roll on by 50 miles
Clear the roads, I?m a-headin? that way
Gonna boogie back to Texas ?cross the U S of A

Boogie back to Texas ? boogie back to Texas
Boogie back to Texas ? boogie back to Texas
We?re gonna boogie back to Texas, eight beats to the mile

We?re gonna boogie back to Texas, eight beats to the mile

Can?t you see I?m on my way ? Boogie!
