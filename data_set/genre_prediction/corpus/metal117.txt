
Yeah yeah look here what I got for you
I can hear you inside screaming
Feed me the juice
There's nothing left for you to do
I got get mine no time to be sorry 

If these are good times 

Hey man ya got some spare change
For me brother?
All I need's a little somethin'
You see me sittin' here face to the gutter
All'ya pass me by ridin' high
If the last one dead's a rotten egg
Meybe I'm better off a bad egg 

All we know
If these are good times
