

You face forecast before you ask for the facts
It's true, and your data's falty, so relax
Let loose prosthetic joy, as confetti bursts in flames
And fire smears like wet paint and I have lost my place, but

ALL ROADS LEAD TO ROME

My eyes seem to lose their shape at the very thought of you
Diving in to steal the reach from my arms
The beat from my heart.

Underneath the waves becomes my only place to hide
A prescription of blood and water will keep me alive
But the sea is filled with cowards who knew the rules to well
To know and act are one,
So why treat them as king and pawn when

ALL ROADS LEAD TO ROME

My eyes seem to lose their shape at the very thought of you
Diving in to steal the reach from my arms
The beat from my heart.

Would you broadcast if you knew the way to Rome?

Trust me, I'm trust worthy

Will I dive so far
That my lungs collapse
And I never see light again?
Or will I
Find
Exactly what
I've been living for?

Brand new colors in shapes I've never seen
Will I hear unheard of tones in songs our vocal chords could Never free?
