
T for Texas, a T for Tennessee
Oh Lord, a T for Texas, T for Tennessee
Or T for Thelma
That gal made a wreck out of me

I'm gonna buy me a pistol
With a great long shiny barrel
Oh Lord, I'm gonna buy me a pistol 
Great long shiny barrel
I'm gonna kill that rounder
Who stole away my gal

T for Texas, a T for Tennessee
Oh Lord, a T for Texas, T for Tennessee
Or T for Thelma
That gal made a wreck out of me

T for Texas, a T for Tennessee
Oh Lord, a T for Texas, T for Tennessee
Or T for Thelma
That gal made a wreck out of me

I ain't gonna marry
I ain't gonna settle down
Boys, sing it now
I ain't gonna marry
I ain't gonna settle down
I'mma be a rounder
Til the police shoot me down

T for Texas, a T for Tennessee
Oh Lord, a T for Texas, T for Tennessee
Or T for Thelma
That gal made a wreck out of me
T for Texas, a T for Tennessee
Oh Lord, a T for Texas, T for Tennessee
Or T for Thelma
That gal made a wreck out of me
