Hide from the sun
Life, an icy tear
Rivers of blood
Serenade my lungs

To drown a rose - To drown a rose

Will he hold my soul
Will he tear my heart
Will he - Will he
Will he rip me apart?

To drown a rose - To drown a rose

Decay of belief
And the highest doubts
We spill our blood
Too late to shout

How we burn
Why keep scum from knowing?
32 creases
Shot in the dark
A flame across the sea
We're going down in history

To drown a rose
To share a dream
The sickness of death
In your eyes - In your schemes

To drown a rose - To drown a rose

Like a crystal tear
I wait to betray
The lie across the sea
My hate is love to me

To drown a rose - To drown a rose

A shot in the dark
Perfumed and sweaty
Why do we mourn
Neutered and muddy?

To drown a rose...
