Yeah, I'm a hustler baby
That's what my daddy's made me

If I had the money to go to a record store, I would
Go to the record store
Go to the record store and put records in my clothes
Go to the record store
Gotta walk out the record door past that record man

Go to the record store and put it in my clothes and walk past that record man
Gotta have the sticky hands when your ass is broke like me
Go to that record store, steal some records man
I'm telling you I'm broke
But I'm surviving and I can cope

Yeah, I'm a hustler baby
That's what my daddy's made me

It's eight o'clock and I got nothing to do
Can't go to the club so I guess I'll go to the record store
Visit my record man with my sticky hands,
Walk out that record door with the records in my clothes

What the fuck is you gonna do?
What the fuck is you gonna do about it?
Nothing.

Push it, push it, push it

I'm a hustler baby
That's what my daddy's made me
