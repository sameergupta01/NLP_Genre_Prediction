
There's room at my table, why don't you pull up a seat?
The music's inviting but I'm staying off of my feet
The floor's getting crowded, but I don't wanna take part
I bet you can guess it's got someting to do with my heart

I could sure use your company now
But don't be mistaking my smile
I'm only in between dances
Sitting it out for a while

The partners are chosen, look at them waltzing away
The tempo gets slower, closer and closer they sway
I've had my moments when I could get lost in the sound
But when the song ended the one in my arms let me down

I could sure use your company now
But don't be mistaking my smile
I'm only in between dances
Sitting it out for a while

Have you been in my shoes?
I serch your eyes for signs
Will you remain, remember my name
After closing time

I could sure use your company now
But don't be mistaking my smile
I'm only in between dances
Sitting it out for a while

I'm only in between dances
Sitting it out for a while
