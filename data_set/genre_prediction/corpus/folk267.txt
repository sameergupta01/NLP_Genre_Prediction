
Angel eyes, strike a match and set this city alight 
All of my life I have been pondering the good done 
Doing right 

Won't you be my mountain bird? 
Forget all you've seen and heard here 
Change your name and cut your hair 
Spread your wings across my window 
Don't go chasing that green back dollar 

There was a time, when I'd sing my songs with a 
Mouthful of rain 
Now I'm a cut price criminal 
First goes your heart, there goes the shame 

Won't you be my mountain bird? 
Forget all you've seen and heard here 
Change your name, change your name and cut your hair 
Spread your wings across my window 
Don't go chasing that green back dollar 

Button up boy, toughen up boy, learn to destroy 
But when all my tears have run dry 
Oh who am I to tell my grief to 

Fight, like a dog, with a big ass bone you'll still be 
A dog 
Kid with a dumbbell ego, shootin' at the neighbours 
For a borrowed God 

Won't you be my mountain bird? 
Forget all you've seen and heard here 
Change your name, change your name and cut your hair 
Spread your wings across my window 
Don't go chasing that green back dollar 

The green back dollar 
Who am I to tell my grief to?
