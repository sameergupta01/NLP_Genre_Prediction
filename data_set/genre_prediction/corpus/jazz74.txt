
Driving by,
The same old town
Your oldsmobile, 
That never let you down
You look so bored
Think your life is waste,
But you should know

That standing by my side
Standing by my side,
Standing by my side,
Standing by my side,
You won't have to hide.

Walking by
An empty street,
Looking at
Your feet

Don't blame yourself
You're not so bad,
So don't be shy,

'cause standing by my side
Standing by my side,
Standing by my side,
(you'll) never have to hide
