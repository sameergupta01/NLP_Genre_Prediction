

You string lies up like lights at
christmas time
they cut through my night and keep me up
run away
run away
run away

What has been going on in that mind
What have you gotta say?
I've gotta mark this down, mark this down now
I'm hit with all of the times you said "fine"
And daylight burns in a way I've never felt
'till now
Felt 'till now

I tear away at myself to get at you
Cut through my thick skull to bleed out you
What has been going on in that mind
What have you gotta say?
I've gotta mark this down, mark this down now
I'm hit with all of the times you said "fine"
And daylight burns in a way I've never felt
'till now
Felt 'till now

We would've made it if you would have
opened your mouth up just one time
Yeah, we would've made it if I would have
opened my ears up just one time
