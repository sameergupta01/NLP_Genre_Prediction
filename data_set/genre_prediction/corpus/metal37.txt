

Enter the archaic abattoir...

Exiled to a pernicious wasteland
My gray matter a thirst
Compelled to restore my deathcamp
Love for surgery in me

A man made predator revealed amidst
The last moiety of humanity in me is stripped
Feeding of a defunct social mess
Enumerate the dead left for you to explore

Abhorrent studies set forth in the abattoir
Intrinsic desecration of a fetid cadaver
Hormones the catalyst of this orgy of the damned
A murderous contempt for science is disclosed

Who am I when push comes to shove?
A madman investing exanimate matters
To descry anatomical enigmae?
Or to deride what he has fathered

Who am I when push comes to shove?
A madman investing exanimate matters
To descry anatomical enigmae?
Or to deride what he has fathered

Abhorrent studies set forth in the abattoir
Intrinsic desecration until death ensues
Nurture the pain which relieves defecation
Degradation of humanity is now exhauled

Exiled to a pernicious wasteland
My mesogenic gray matter, a thirst compelled
To restore my deathcamp
An illusive love for surgery in me, in me

A man-made predator revealed amidst
The last moiety of humanity in me is stripped, is stripped
Feeding of a defunct social mess
Enumerate the dead left for you to enjoy
