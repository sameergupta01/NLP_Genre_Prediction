
If losing sleep were any indication
Of the loving that I've missed
I would wrap myself around you
But how likely can that be when I feel like this
And if life were not unfortunate
And reason blew like summer through the trees
I would stop to let you catch me
But I think that you would find me on my knees


And it's gonna be another long one tonight
It's just me and my well-intentioned spite
I said someone did this to me
But no one did, there's no injustices
I just can't afford to be right no more
I bought myself another bad dream tonight
With these little boys in my head sleeping tight
It's gonna be another long one tonight


There is comfort in a memory
And in roses just before you cut them down
There is danger in most everything
That's all the better when it's not around
And the last time I had the sense to notice 
You were right here being kind
But if I think that you are with me
Then I know that you can always change your mind


And it's gonna be another long one tonight
It's just me and my well-intentioned spite
I said someone did this to me
But no one did, there's no injustices
I just can't afford to be right no more
I bought myself another bad dream tonight
With these little boys in my head sleeping tight
It's gonna be another long one tonight
