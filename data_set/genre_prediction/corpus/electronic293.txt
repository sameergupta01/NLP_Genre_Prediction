
Oh, like many a male,
I get angst in my pants
And goddamn it to hell,
It don't help if I dance

And you, you're not doing too well
All the blogs are about you, girl
They caught you in the park after dark
Giving head to a statue, girl
Oh, cruel!

'''I didn't mean to do you no harm
I just underestimated my charm
And if I ever bother to tell you the truth, oh baby
You're too much sugar for my sweet tooth, all right I

Didn't mean to do you no harm
I just underestimated my charm
And if I ever bother to tell you the truth, oh baby
You're too much sugar for my sweet tooth, all right now'''

You're on your honeymoon
And you're sending me notes
You hope to see me soon,
You've got "see" wrapped in quotes
I used to find it funny to say, 
"What's your man got to do with me?"
But then I saw him downtown,
Placing bets on the hounds
He was as big as a house! 
We can't be messin' around!

You're too much sugar for my...'''

''Bom bom, bom bom, bom bom, bom bom
Beep beep, beep beep, boooo
Bom bom, bom bom, bom bom, bom bom
Beep beep, beep beep, boooo''

Oooh, every time we kiss,
It's like an inside joke 
I always miss.
Our love is like a tug-of-war
Don't touch me girl, 
I can't hug no more!

Every time we kiss,
It's like an inside joke 
I always miss.
Our love is like a tug-of-war
Don't touch me girl, 
I can't hug no more!

''Whoa oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh ohhh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh ohhh oh oh''
