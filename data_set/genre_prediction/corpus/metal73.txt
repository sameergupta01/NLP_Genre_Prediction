
From the soul to its waste
The Common hates his evil twin?—
Everything invaded
In its simplicity

How did you get inside me?

Still all fascinated
Invaded?—?by everything

In the first morning light
The touch of death covering skies
Everything invaded
And all the fears inspired

How did you get inside me?

Still all celebrated
Invaded?—?by everything

Everything so full
In the lives I have taken with me
All our moments wasted
All is getting in

Still all violated
Divided by everything

And all the grace disturbed
All existence?—?false
All your dead generations!
I am a son of yours
And I am coming back

Everything invaded
In its finality
Tell me will it hurt
When you get out— outside of me?

Everything is breaking
Why have we ever stopped here
Everything invaded
I am a son of yours
And I am giving up

Everything invaded
Invaded by everything
