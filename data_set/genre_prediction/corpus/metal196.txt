

To see the actor without tears
Dark rivers carve the years between the lies of self control
In my psychotic karmic fear, I own your tears anyway 
And I am you and we are not afraid

And we won't be here for long
The heart collector sings his song that's slowly boiling over

Nevermore to feel the pain
The heart collector sang
And I won't be feeling hollow for so long
Nevermore to feel the pain
The words fall out like fire
Just believe when you can't believe anymore

The stage is empty now
We hope, we hold and cannot allow the corrupt ecletic
Takes his fatal bow

And we won't be here for long
The heart collector sings his song again

Nevermore to feel the pain
The heart collector sang
And I won't be feeling hollow for so long

Nevermore to feel the pain
The words fall out like fire
Just believe when you can't believe anymore
