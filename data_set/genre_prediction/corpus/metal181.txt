

I taste the fear to numb the tear
Trapped by the source of my infection 
I play the martyr submerged in this pool
The corporation used me like they brainwashed you

Life is seen, so cold and benign
I don't want to be saved
I'm next in line to die
Labeled sick, but I'm just a man

Everyone I love has left me for dead
This void illusion I suffer for
They made me their god
And I am so much more than you 

Life is seen so cold and benign
I don't want to be saved 
I'm next in line to die 
I don't want to be saved, I'm next in line

I taste the fear to numb the tear
Trapped by the source of my infection 
Life is seen through heroin
Dreaming, cold and benign

I don't want to be saved
I'm next in line to die 
I don't want to be saved
I'm next in line and I don't want to be saved 

I'm a dead man, I'm a sick man
I'm the pilot of my destruction 
I'm a dead man, I'm a sick man
I'm the pilot of my destruction 
The pilot of my destruction
