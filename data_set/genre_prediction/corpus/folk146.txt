
Don't sing love songs, you'll wake my mother
She's sleeping here right by my side
In her right hand a silver dagger
She says that I can't be your bride

All men are fools, so says my mother
They'll tell you again love and lies
And then they'll go and court some other
Leave you alone to pine inside

My daddy is a handsome devil
He's got a chain five miles long
On every link a heart does dangle
Of another maid he's loved and wronged

Go court another tender maiden
In hopes that she might be your bride
For I've been warned, so I decided
I'll sleep alone all of my life

Don't sing love songs, you'll wake my mother
She's sleeping here right by my side
In her right hand a silver dagger
She says that I can't be your bride
