I've watched you rise up and i've watched you fall down
'til you've lost everything but what money can own.
And you feel alright now, but for how long?
You feel alright now, how long?

Do me a favour, stay away from my door.
I could use some good company but i don't care for yours.
No more pageants, no more.
No more pageants, no more.

I find your words empty and you know as a rule
To you i have purposefully never been cruel.



But you waste my time, such fools.
You waste my time, such fools.

My love is not here, my love is away.
You've caught me alone but you've nothing to say.
And it's time to leave now and you know the way.
And it's time to leave and you know the way.

Go and live in the country and i'll stay in town.
I have everything but what money can own.
And i'll be just fine now, so long.
I'll be just fine now, so long.
So long.
