
World without sound
Can't you keep the noise down
'Else you gonna make the baby cry

Over split blood
Heavens anyone would
Think you had an axe to grind

Baby look out here come the Romans
With their steely gaze they're climbing on your sofa
Cheap veneers and a swinging brik for a heart
Forked tongues same song we're tired and we wanna go
Home

Hide the swag bag
Quick before the tongues wag
Cross your heart and claim a noble cause

Quote the scriptures
Paint your pretty pictures
Fleece them with your filthy paws

Baby look out here come the Romans
With their steely gaze they're climbing on your sofa
Cheap veneers and a swinging brik for a heart
Forked tongues same song we're tired and we wanna go
Home

Bad news spread fast and they're spreading,
They're spreading like a chip pan fire
We must confess
We ain't progressed
Since Elvis has left the building a mess

World without sound
Can't you keep the noise down
'Else you gonna make the baby cry

Over split blood
Heavens anyone would
Think you had an axe to grind

Baby look out here come the Romans
With their steely gaze they're climbing on your sofa
Cheap veneers and a swinging brik for a heart
Forked tongues same song we're tired and we wanna go
Home
