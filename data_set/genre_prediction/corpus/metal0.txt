You know I can be like that man you can't see. Guess what's hiding in me.
It's that thing I stole from in sickness. I know you'll clean this blood off
my business and embrace me.

Now you can't stand it (don't ask me to)
Help just cuz you're stranded (I don't want to)
You know where you'll end up (not in my head)
Screamin? and alone (between the naked and the dead)

Souls are lost in my kingdom
I've waited to see what you could bring

You'll fall

[CHOR.]

You'll fall into my possession, then you'll see
I'm Judas in black and I love it
You'll fall into my hands, where's your ripcord? Hate me?

Feel deceived and hated, thought you would make it, hold that glass and
break it, pull that smile and fake it.
Sit up and spit up
Really wish you would wake up

Souls are lost in my kingdom
I've waited to see what you could bring.
I'm heedless as I take you in.
And feed you my mind and sin

[Repeat Chor.]

The purest of all black and damned souls.
Now I've claimed what was yours and I will use it as I damn well please.
You'll see me coming but you won't feel as I enter your body and rip out the
real you.

Inside you is me
As you act I breathe
Guess what's up my sleeve
