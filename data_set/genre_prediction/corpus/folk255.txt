

i want to live on a street in the movies
the one with the trees that filters the sun out
little by little i could loosen up there
and take the long way around
take the long way around

i want to live on a street in the movies
i want my mind on undemanding things
honestly i could live without all of this
and take the long way around
take the long way around

where you are alive and well in me
