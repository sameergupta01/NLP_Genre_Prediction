
It was all his fault,
introduced me to knowitall and the (cannibal)

By the time they started showing up,
I ran the risk of blowing up
These times, these times get tough 
So if i stay we're going to see who's had enough

By the time i needed backing up,
ya he was watching, cracking up
This time, this time it's tough
Well, here I am and now and I think I've had enough

(Ahh...) Stand back! 
Take that and that and that

You're always up to no good
Ya you're always up to no good

Ah, I was trapped in from all sides
Caught in a slew of nasty lies
No there is no escape,
only flailing arms and bellyaches

When it all started coming down tonight,
boy, did you run and hide?
Well, I guess that we all make mistakes
I guess I forgave you, didn't I?

(Ahh...) Stand back!
You're such a big brat

Ya you're always up to no good
Ya you're always up to no good

(Instrumental)

Ya you're always up to no good
Ya you're always up to no good

By the time they started showing up,
I ran the risk of blowing up
These times, these times get tough 
So if I stay we're going to see who's had enough

By the time i needed backing up,
Ya he was watching, cracking up
This time, this time it's tough
Well here I am now and i think I've had enough

(Ahh...) Stand back!
Stand back!
Stand back!
You... big... brat!
