
Why you being a dickhead for?
Stop being a dickhead
Why you being a dickhead for?
You're just fucking up situations

Why you being a dickhead for?
Stop being a dickhead
Why you being a dickhead for?
You're just fucking up situations

Shiny floor, slippery feet
Lights are dim, my eyes can't meet
The reflection that turns my images
Upside down so I can't see

Think you know everything
You really don't know nothing
I wish that you were more intelligent
So you could see that what you are doing is
So shitty, to me

Thirty five
People couldn't count
On two hands the amount of times you made me stop
Stop and think why are you being such a dickhead for?

Stop being a dickhead
Why you being a dickhead for?
You're just fucking up situations
Why you being a dickhead for?
Stop being a dickhead
Why you being a dickhead for?
You're just fucking up situations

Stop, now don't show, just have a think before you
Will you, stop, now don't show, just have a think before you
Will you stop, no don't show, just have a think before you
Will you stop, don't show, just have a think before you

My brain and my bones don't want to take, this anymore
So

Why you being a dickhead for?
Stop being a dickhead
Why you being a dickhead for?
You're just fucking up situations
