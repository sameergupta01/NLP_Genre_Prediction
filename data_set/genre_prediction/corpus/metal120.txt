
Start off the day say you wanna play
You don't wanna pay but you wanna stay
Do what you want when you wanna do it
Could of had more but you went and blew it
Now the time has come time to have some fun
Won't see the sun until I'm done
There's one thing before we begin
Get on the table and let me see some skin 

Back to the story you know you really bore me
Hard enough to live when you're always horny
I like you you love me
Simple as that it's gotta be
I'm givin' you a chance you better take it
An orgasm you fake it
Something you should know before I'm good to go
We're gonna have sex I gotta see a show
