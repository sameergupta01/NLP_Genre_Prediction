I didn't sleep all night

I didn't sleep all night

I didn't sleep all night

I didn't sleep all night



Made a phone call last night

I've been thinking about it all day

I made you cry last night

But it's ok cause I heard you say

I love you



I floated in those words

I floated in those words

I don't even know why I feel what I feel

I don't even know why I think what I think

I don't even know why I do what I do

I don't even know why I say what I say



You're making me nervous

It all falls apart

But it's ok

But it's ok

It won't fall apart
