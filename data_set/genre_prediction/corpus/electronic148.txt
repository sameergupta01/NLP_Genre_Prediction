It's been a long time coming
my heart is aching
I'm waiting to hear that we're okay
don't know what to say
I'm shaking
feels like, I'm breaking
and I'm not so sure if it's just a phase

I love it when I have you in my arms
I love it when you're holding me you make me feel so me

trust me,
you said a thousand times
but I'm wanting more than you could ever know
And what we got, oh we got something
more than I could have imagined
so why do we have to be apart


I love it when I have you in my arms
I love it when you're holding me you make me feel so me
I love it when I have you in my arms
I love it when you're holding me you make me feel so me

I just want to be with you
Oh, you want me too

I love it when I have you in my arms
I love it when you're holding me you make me feel so me
oh, I love it when I have you in my arms
I love it when you're holding me you make me feel so me

I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it,
I love it, I loooove it
