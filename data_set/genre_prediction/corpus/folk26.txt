JUDAS

Now if I help you, it matters that you see
These sordid kinda things are coming hard to me.
It's taken me some time to work out what to do.
I weighed the whole thing out before I came to you.
I have no thought at all about my own reward.
I really didn't come here of my own accord.
Just don't say I'm ... damned for all time.
I came because I had to; I'm the one who saw.
Jesus can't control it like he did before.
And furthermore I know that Jesus thinks so too.
Jesus wouldn't mind that I was here with you.
I have no thought at all about my own reward.
I really didn't come here of my own accord.
Just don't say I'm ... damned for all time.
Annas, you're a friend, a worldly man and wise.
Caiaphas, my friend, I know you sympathise.
Why are we the prophets? Why are we the ones
Who see the sad solution - know what must be done?
I have no thought at all about my own reward.
I really didn't come here of my own accord.
Just don't say I'm damned for all time.

ANNAS

Cut the protesting, forget the excuses.
We want information. Get up of the floor.

CAIAPHAS

We have the papers we need to arrest him.
You know his movements. We know the law.

ANNAS

Your help in this matter won't go unrewarded.

CAIAPHAS

We'll pay you in silver, cash on the nail.
We just need to know where the soldiers can find him.

ANNAS

With no crowd around him.

CAIAPHAS

Then we can't fail.

JUDAS

I don't want your blood money!

CAIAPHAS

Oh, that doesn't matter, our expenses are good.

JUDAS

I don't need your blood money!

ANNAS

But you might as well take it. We think that you should.

CAIAPHAS

Think of the things you could do with that money,
Choose any charity - give to the poor.
We've noted your motives.
We've noted your feelings.
This isn't blood money - it's a ...

ANNAS

A fee.

CAIAPHAS

A fee nothing more.

JUDAS

On Thursday night you'll find him where you want him.
Far from the crowds, in the Garden of Gethsemane.

Well done Judas. Good old Judas.
