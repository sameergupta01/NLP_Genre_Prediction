So what you do, you keep on playing, you play on, player
From love to confusion you keep getting but you keep los'sun
So what cha find comforting you've proven, booz ¡®on, heart bruis' on
I'm the one, from the high note to the low pains you see destruction but your like a man,
All the voices their hid in your head, they all laugh ha ha ha ha ha yeah
From your denials to your delusions everything you gain you keep los'son
What you not know it's an elusion, so what the hell your doing

He's looking and looking, he's looking and looking, he's looking and looking
He's looking at you, he's looking at me, he's looking and looking
He's looking and looking, He's looking at you, he's looking at me
He's looking at us, he's looking at we, ah shit
He's looking at

You wake up every morning but baby boy your not sleep
Your test full but your not on
Your running fast but your not on your feet and your speed is there
You run on but you not know, your climb inside but you can't grow
Festering and festering til you fall to the floor
You screamed on but don't say
You work and work with no pay, you punch a clock but never end your day
You take vacation but your not playing what we say by this time here my friends drink three
You cry cry revolution, but which you want a solution
But your more content being in pollution jump in the motion, and ask the notion

He's looking and looking, he's looking and looking, he's looking and looking
He's looking at you, he's looking at me, he's looking at looking
He's looking and looking, He's looking and you, he's looking at me
He's looking at us, he's looking at we, ah shit
He's looking at

Self love self preservation, Self love self preservation, Self love self preservation
Self love self preservation, Self love self preservation, Self love self preservation
He's looking at Self love self preservation, Self love self preservation, Self love self preservation
Repeat

L O V E love yourself
L O V E love yourself
repeat

If you don't like your job, why don't you just quit stop being a bitch love yourself
If you believe things kind work out easily,
I'm telling you if you don't like what your mother's telling you
Then be a grown man and stand up on your own two and love yourself
If your girlfriend's is on welfare, then baby walk away
You don't have to care and love yourself
And if standing on the corner and pushing rocks up in your sock
Ain't what you want to do to night then love yourself

L O V E your L O V E your L O V E self
He's looking at love
