Hey!
Hi hey!
[voices]
Here we go again, here we go again
[voices]
O Fortuna, stay around me
Be my lover eternally
O Gloria, in ecstasy
As my hands read your body
O Maria, honestly
Would you betray your family for me
We'll be one with everything
I'll make sure you get there
Before I come, before I join
And we grab the stars, capture the universe
Hey, hey, mph, mph, ha, ha
Hey, hey, mph, mph, ha, ha
All different but yet so the same
It's always new,it's always fresh
You nail me down, I take the blame
For god my soul, for you my flesh
We'll be one with everything
I'll make sure you get there
Before I come, before I join
And we grab the stars, capture the universe
