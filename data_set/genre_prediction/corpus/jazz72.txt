
Love has truly been good to me
Not even one sad day 
Or minute have I had since you've come my way
I hope you know I'd gladly go
Anywhere you take me

It's so amazing to be loved 
I'll follow you to the moon in the sky above

Got to tell you how you thrill me
I'm happy as I can be
You have come and changed my whole world
Bye bye sadness hello mellow
What a wonderful day

It's so amazing to be loved
I'll follow you to the moon in the sky above

And it's so amazing, amazing
I could stay forever, forever
I would leave you never, never
Cause we've got amazing love
Truly it's amazing, amazing
Love brought us together, together
I would leave you never, never
Cause we've got amazing love

So amazing and I've been waiting
For a love like you.

It's so amazing to be loved
I'll follow you to the moon in the sky above
