
I must have died and gone to heaven
'Cause it was quarter past eleven
On a Saturday in 1999
Right across from where I'm standing
On the dancefloor she was landing
It was clear that she was from another time
Like some baby Barbarella
With the stars as her umbrella
She asked me if I'd like to magnetize
Do I have to go star-trekking?
'Cause it's you, I should be checking
So she laser beamed me with her cosmic eyes
Oh now

She's just a cosmic girl
Whoa yeah
From another galaxy
My heart's at zero gravity
She's from a cosmic world
(Wha-wha-wha-wha) Putting me in ecstasy
Ooh, transmitting on my frequency
(Wha-wha-wha-wha) She's cosmic

I'm scanning all my radars
Well she said she's from a quasar
Forty thousand million light years away
It's a distant solar system
Tried to phone, but they don't list 'em
So I asked her for her number all the same
She said: "Step in my transporter 
So I can teleport ya
All around my heavenly body"
Oh, this could be a close encounter
I should take care not to flounder
Sends me into hyperspace
When I see her pretty face

She's just a cosmic girl
From another galaxy
My heart's at zero gravity
She's from a cosmic world
(Wha-wha-wha-wha) Putting me in ecstasy
Transmitting on my frequency
(Wha-wha-wha-wha) She's cosmic

(Send me into hyperspace
When I see her pretty face) [x2]

Send me into hyperspace
When I see her pretty face [x8]

(La-la-la) She's just a cosmic girl
(Ah-ah-ah) From another galaxy
(Ah-ah-ah) Transmitting on my frequency
(Ah-ah-ah) Yeah, cosmic, oh
(La-la-la) Can't you be my cosmic woman?
(Ah-ah-ah) I need you, I want you 
(Ah-ah-ah) To be my cosmic girl for the rest of time
(Ah-ah-ah)

Oh, I'm losing my mind (ah-ah-ah)
Oh my cosmic girl, yeah (ah-ah-ah)
She
Putting me an ecstasy (ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah)
