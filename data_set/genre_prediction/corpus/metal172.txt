

There is no control in the world today
And there's still no order to this game we all play

Maybe none of us know
(What's real)

There's no constraint when the walls cave in
The neuron turn on, the game begins to fade away

Maybe none of us know
Maybe none of us want to hear
Never push against the flow
Aimlessly

Feel the flow
And let all thought fade
We shall be one
For this sacrament has begun

Lucy in the sky with diamond eyes
Long since dark, I wear her disguise of light

Maybe none of us know
Maybe none of us want to hear
Never push against the flow
Aimlessly

Feel the flow
And let all thought fade
We shall be one
For this sacrament has begun

(This sacrament is a state of mind)

There's no control in the world today
And there's still no order to this game we all play called life

Maybe none of us know
Maybe none of us want to hear
Never push against the flow
Aimlessly

Feel the flow
And let all thought fade
We shall be one
Through this sacrament

Feel the flow
(To become one with the flow)
And let all thought fade
(Is to realise purpose)
We shall be one
(To realise purpose)
For this sacrament has begun
(Is to become one with the flow) 
(Become one with the flow)
This sacrament has begun
(Become one with the flow)
This sacrament 
(Has begun)
