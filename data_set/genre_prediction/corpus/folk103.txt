I may run and hide
When you're screamin' my name, alright
But let me tell you now
There are prices to fame, alright
All of our time spent in flashes of light

CHORUS
All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down
You can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

Looking at the crowd
And I see your body sway, c'mon
Wishin' I could thank you in a different way, c'mon
'Cause all of your time spent keeps us alive

CHORUS - repeat

that's right

All of your time spent keeps us alive

CHORUS - repeat

Yeah, every time we're down
Yeah, you can make it right
Yeah, and that's what makes you larger than life

CHORUS - repeat
