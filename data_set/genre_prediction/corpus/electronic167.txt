should've known that this would end
stopped being my friend
some thing's just aren't worth mending
some messages aren't worth unsending
the way you walked past the door
oblivious to me writing on the floor
from the pain you inflicted
and all the pills that the doctor prescripted
just don't work anymore
they don't work anymore
they don't work anymore
they don't work anymore
it's not the point that i'm at
you fucked me up pretty bad
now it's all too late
you can forward my mail to the state
cause i joined the foreign legion
joined the foreign legion
joined the foreign legion
joined the foreign legion
joined the foreign legion
joined the foreign legion
joined the foreign legion
