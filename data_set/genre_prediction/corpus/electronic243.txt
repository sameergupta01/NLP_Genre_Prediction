I ride the Greyhound bus, I ride it everywhere.
Oh how I count the ways. The answer lies within me.
I love my rollerskates, I ride them everywhere.
Circle, frozey, turtle knee. How can I find the saviour?

Got the coolest BMX, I ride it everywhere.
'Cause nobler to die for truth, is holy to repair one sin.
My daddy has a Subaru, I ride it everywhere.
Well mine travles like a wave, my mind travles like a wave.
Well I ride it everywhere.
