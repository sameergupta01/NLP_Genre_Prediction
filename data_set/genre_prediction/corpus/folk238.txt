
Okay, go ahead and stay
But don?t sleep in too late, I?ve got to wake alone
It?s just that goodnight is easier than goodbye
I?m already sold on ending up alone

And oh don?t you dare pray for my salvation, dear
Can?t you tell that I?m in love with you here?

So make your plans, make them all in stride
Oh, you better hide whatever's on the line
It?s just that goodnight is easier than goodbye
I?m already sold on ending up alone

And oh don?t you dare pray for my salvation, dear
Can?t you tell that I?m in love with you here?

And if you?re bent on wasting all of your time
Come around, come around, come around
And if you?re bent on wasting all of your time
Come around, come around

And oh don?t you dare pray for my salvation, dear
Can?t you tell that I?m in love with you here?
Pray for your salvation, dear
Can?t you tell that you?re in need of [Incomprehensible]

Okay, go ahead and stay
But don?t sleep in too late, I?ve got to wake alone
