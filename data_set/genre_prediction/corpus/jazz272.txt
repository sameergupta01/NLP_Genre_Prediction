
Candlelight, a glass of wine, setting for the special time with you babe
Feels like a dream but I'm still awake
As I'm lookin' in your eyes I'm caught up in paradise and ooh babe
No one else can make me feel this way

You leave me breathless, helpless when you're here so close to me
Every moment perfect, wish this could last eternally
I love the feelin' I get with every kiss you're givin' me
I don't know what it is about you babe
But I wish that you could stay, you leave me breathless

Just one thought of you and I and I start feelin' butterflies, ooh babe
I get so weak, I can hardly speak
'Cause boy your love's so heavenly it's like the man on other galaxy
It's true, you know just what you do to me

You leave me breathless, helpless when you're here so close to me
Every moment perfect, wish this could last eternally
I love the feelin' I get with every kiss you're givin' me
I don't know what it is about you babe
But I wish that you could stay, you leave me breathless

Feels so good when [Incomprehensible]
Your arms they take me to a higher place
So when you say don't be afraid
I'm down to go with you all of the way

I hold on tight and never let you go
Touch the sky and watch the world below
Just you and me, a love so sweet
It's where I want to be

You leave me breathless, helpless when you're here so close to me
Every moment perfect, wish this could last eternally
I love the feelin' I get with every kiss you're givin' me
I don't know what it is about you babe
But I wish that you could stay, you leave me breathless

Breathless, helpless when you're here so close to me
Every moment perfect, wish this could last eternally
I love the feelin' I get with every kiss you're givin' me
Don't know what it is about you babe
But I wish that you could stay, you leave me breathless

So breathless, leave me breathless, breathless
You leave me breathless, breathless
I don't know what it is about you babe
You leave me breathless, breathless
