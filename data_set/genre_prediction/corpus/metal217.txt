Before me now
I see a dying planet
Captured souls
With microchips implanted When warning came
You stayed the same
When warning came
You stayed the same I am crumbling over the obstacles
Nothing left to entertain
The smell of burning corpses
A new world domain I saw them coming
A world from a far
I saw them coming
From a distant star I will break out from this madness
There is nothing here but sadness
I'm dancing in the hellfire
Hellfire
I will break out from this madness
There is nothing here but sadness
I'm burning in the hellfire
Hellfire Before me now I see a future
A future black
Oh come and save me
I'm under soul attack A time of changes
It re-arranges
A time of changes I will break out from this madness
There is nothing here but sadness
I'm burning in the hellfire
Hellfire
I will break out, out, out from
This madness
I'm turning in the hellfire
Hellfire I will break out from this madness
There is nothing here but sadness
I'm dancing in the hellfire
Hellfire
Hellfire
There must be a way
I'm waiting
Waiting for the day
Hellfire
Hellfire
Burns higher
Hellfire
Higher
Higher
Hellfire
Only blood remains
Hellfire
There is nothing more to gain Take me
