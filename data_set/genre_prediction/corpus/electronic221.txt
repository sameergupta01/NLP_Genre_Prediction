Walk alone tonight
Under the starry skies

I don't feel the way
That I've been feeling before you came into my life
And I knew that you
could turn me on every time you came into my mind

I'm trying to realize
If I can be what you want and make your love just mine
Don't play with me now
You'd better come to me, you'd better come to me

I will walk alone tonight
Under the starry skies
Want to be alone tonight
Forever now on my mind
I've been with you so long
And you know what I want and then

Tell me why you won't love
Why my love
Tell me why you won't love
Why I don't know
Tell me why

I don't need to say
that I've been dreaming about you that long long night
and I wait for you
to call me now and to tell me that you will be mine

I found you are so bright
That's why I want you in my life


And I want you right now
Don't play with me now
You'd better come to me, you'd better come to me

I will walk alone tonight
Under the starry skies
Want to be alone tonight
Forever now on my mind
I've been with you so long
And you know what I want and then

Tell me why you won't love
Why my love
Tell me why you won't love
Why I don't know
Tell me why you won't love
Why my love
Tell me why you won't love
Why I don't know
Tell me why

Walk alone tonight
Under the starry skies

Tell me why you won't love
Why my love
Tell me why you won't love
Why I don't know
Tell me why you won't love
Why my love
Tell me why you won't love
Why I don't know
Tell me why
