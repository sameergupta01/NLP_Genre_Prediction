It serves me right to suffer
It serves me right to be alone
It serves me right to suffer
It serves me right to be alone

You see I'm living in the memory
Of a day that has passed and gone

Everytime i see a woman
You know it makes me think about mine
Everytime i see a woman
You know it makes me think about mine

You see I'm living in the memory
Of a woman I've left behind

It serves me right to suffer
It serves me right to be alone
It serves me right to suffer
It serves me right to be alone

Now I'm living in the memory
Of a woman that has passed and gone
