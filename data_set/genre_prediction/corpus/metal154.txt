
My perfect reflection swims
through the drowning pool. The sky is gone.
My world is in deconstruction

The fallen that dreams suicide 
Takes the needle, instead of the gun
The victim who self crucifies can't realize
Christ is a weapon that chisels at our lives
Deconstruction
The martyr takes his aim and wounds the holy man
And on the eighth day God made the art of war
And laughing planned the end

Who will tend the garden when the snake swallows the light?
Who will eat the decay when the worms have lost their sight?
Who will rape the weak when there's nothing left to gain?
Who will till the soil of these barren black remains?

Deconstruction, deconstruction

Who will lick my wounds when they take away my speech?
Will you stand in line while the shepherd hunts his sheep?
Could you see tomorrow if I took away your eyes?
Can you crawl from under new age prophecy's despise?

Deconstruction, deconstruction

Deconstruct my reality and let me slip away, I am the dog

Who will tend the garden when the snake swallows the light?
Who will eat the decay when the worms have lost their sight?
Who will rape the weak when there's nothing left to gain?
Who will till the soil of these barren black remains?

Deconstruction, deconstruction
Deconstruction, deconstruction

Our world is in deconstruction
Our world
