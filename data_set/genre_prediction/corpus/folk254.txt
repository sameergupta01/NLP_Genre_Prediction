

Sleep my love while I come undone
And I'll brace myself for when you're done
Sweet dreams my love
Take them all
Take them all
While I Absorb you and what you've done
What you've done

You never gave it wind
You never let me in

You shine like winter under sun
Under sun
You kill me with christmas
And I hope you find the day that you
came undone
While I Absorb you and what you've done
What you've done

You never gave it wind
You never let me in

Whisper till the coffee comes
Whisper till you come undone
Whisper till the film starts
Whisper till I fall apart
