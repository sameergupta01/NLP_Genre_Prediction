Gather-me-grandchildren if you love a good mystery
Gather-me-grandchildren for a little church history
It's 2044
You're avoiding our turn-of-the-century ways

How did we strike it rich?
Kissing up to the powerful
How did we make our pitch?
Satellites by the towerful
Why do you young people have to go and get caught up in a radical phase?

My conscience was clear and my wallet was full
I didn't hear none of this "sacrifice" bull
Tough times call for a backtrack
Gimme that old-time easy listening

Cuddle up, yeah, yeah
12 Hours, twice a day
Cuddle up, yeah, yeah
Simmer down
Attaway

Color me old-fashioned, but I still remember when
The sermons were affirming, 'cause the Lord liked us better then
It's 2044
And I don't want to be my brother's keeper no more

Color me chicken yellow if I liked it in the ozone
Call me lemon jello if I lacked a little backbone
We're King's Kids, dang it
And we used to know what a housekeeper was for

Tickle my ear and I'll pay for your show
Sing about stuff that I already know
Whisper sweet nothings
Pour a nightcap
Gimme that old-time easy listening

Cuddle up, yeah, yeah
12 Hours, twice a day
Cuddle up, yeah, yeah
Simmer down
Attaway

Cuddle up, yeah, yeah
Order now, don't delay
Cuddle up, yeah, yeah
Sleep it off
Drool away

Gather-me-round children, 'cause your faith is a mystery
Gather me grandchildren for a little church history
It's 2044
And I miss our turn-of-the-century ways

How did we strike it rich?
Kissing up to the powerful
How did we make our pitch?
Satellites by the towerful
Why do you young hotheads have to go and get caught up in a radical phase?

I'm ok, you're ok, we're ok, so
I think I'm gonna buy my own radio show
Spread the good news and the Barry Manilow
Happy talk, no rock, non-stop easy listening
