They're critical of other birds
Farmers don't appreciate 'em
Though they don't say it in so many words

Jack's crows Jack's crows
Where everybody's from
And nobody goes
That's where you're gonna find Jack's crows

Jack's crows have a bad reputation
Some of them are known as thieves
They're involved in strange celebrations
And magic on All Hallow's Eve

Jack's crows Jack's crows
Where everybody's from
And nobody goes
That's where you're gonna find Jack's crows

Jack's crows are all very ancient
No relation to the crows of Jim
Jim was driven to the shadows
But now you're seeing more of him

With Jack's crows Jack's crows
Where everybody's from
And nobody goes
That's where you're gonna find Jack's crows

Jack's crows are in for a murder
A murder is a gathering
Some watch some go a little further
Some eat what the others bring

To Jack's crows Jack's crows
Where everybody's from
And nobody goes
That's where you're gonna find Jack's crows
