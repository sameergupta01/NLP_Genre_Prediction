There is something and it can change
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey the time has come to understand
Teen dreams have worked their way through me now
There is something and it can change
Tell me what it is, tell how it works
Keep trying, keep searching
Tell me what it is, tell how it works
Keep trying, keep searching yeah!
No, no, no, no you're sometime close to lose your mind
Ha, ha, ha, ha too much sun will leave you blind
There is something and it can change
Tell me what it is, tell how it works
Keep trying, keep searching
Tell me what it is, tell how it works
Keep trying, keep searching yeah!
No matter where you start
No matter where you go
Stay on your path my friend
It's gonna lead you there
No matter where, no matter how
No matter where you start...Hey!
No matter where you go...Hey! Hey!
Stay on your path my friend
It's gonna lead you there
No matter where, no matter how
Every prayer's got to reach their goal
As every stream will reach the sea
Hey, hey, hey, hey the time has come to understand
Teen dreams have worked their way through me now
There is something and it can change
Tell me what it is, tell how it works
Keep trying, keep searching
Tell me what it is, tell how it works
Keep trying, keep searching yeah!
