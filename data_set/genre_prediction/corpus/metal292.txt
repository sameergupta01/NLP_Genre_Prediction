Christmas
Lead and we'll follow
Hope and tomorrow
Magic and dreams

You are all this and more now
Childhood recalls how
You are
Visions and...

Christmas
We are your children
You take us back when
Ever we call
Each year we are here waiting
Anticipating
As the snow starts to fall

Merry Christmas
Merry, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry, Merry Christmases

Ornaments and evergreens
With packages as yet unseen
All wrapped in paper
Colored bright
Reflecting candles in the night

With carolers and mistletoe
And stockings all hung in a row
Or fireplaces glowing red
With children safely sent to bed

Ring the bells, Ring the bells
Let the churches ring the bells!

Joy to the world, the Lord has come
Let his light shine on everyone

Christmas lead and we'll follow



From London, Rome and Paris
To Berlin and Tokyo
Winter never really starts
Until it's given its first snow
