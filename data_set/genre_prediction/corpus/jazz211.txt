
The more I think the less I see
When I'm able to walk I'm queen of my world
I let it rain on my skin
I don't let myself down, I don't let myself down
Just wanna be one with you, I wanna be one with you

The more I think the less I do
When I'm able to talk I'm queen of my world
I let it rain on my skin
I don't ask myself why, I don't ask myself why
I wanna be one with you, I wanna be one with you

All I want is to rock your soul
All I want is to rock your soul
All I want is to rock your soul
And all I want is to rock your soul
All I want is to rock your soul
All I want is to rock your soul

I feel closer to the clouds
I'm touching all the highest leaves
On top of the trees my desire's release
So we let it rain…
On our skin you're holding my hand I'm holding your life 
'N feel like I'm one with you, I'm one with you

And all I want is to rock your soul
All I want is to rock your soul
All I want is to rock your soul
All I want is to rock your soul
All I want is to rock your soul
All I want is to rock your soul

I think I have to give you something more than words
Is that something so I show you my dreams, to make 'em our dreams
Won't you just be, for I'm what you see

And all I want is to rock your soul
All I want is to rock your soul
All I want is to rock your soul
All I want is to rock your soul
All I want is to rock your soul
All I want is to rock your soul
''(Together with the sun, we shine all the way, together with the rain, we fall through the air…)''

All I want is to rock your soul
All I want is to rock your soul
All I want is to rock your soul
All I want is to rock your soul
All I want is to rock your soul
All I want is to rock your soul

Together with the rain, and the sun, only with the rain, with the rain and the sun, with the sun, with the sun, with the sun...
