[E]Well I left my home down on the rural route
I told my paw I'm going steppin out and get the
[A7] Honky tonk blues,
Yeah the honky tonk [E] blues
Well [B7] lord I got 'em,
I got the ho-on-ky tonk [E] blues.

[E] Well I went to a dance and I wore out my shoes
woke up this mornin wishin I could lose
them jumpin [A7] honky tonk blues,
Yeah the honky tonk [E]blues
Well [B7] lord I got 'em,
I got the ho-on-ky tonk [E] blues.

Solo [E] [A] [E] [B7]

[E]Well I stopped into every place in town
this city life has really got me down
I got [A7] the honky tonk blues,
Yeah the honky tonk [E]blues
Well [B7] lord I got em,
got the ho-on-ky tonk [E] blues.

[E] I'm gonna tuck my worries underneath my arm
And scat right back to my pappy's farm
And leave these [A7] honky tonk blues,
Yeah the honky tonk [E] blues
[B7] Well lord I got 'em,
I got the ho-on-ky tonk [E] blues.

When I get home to my Ma and Pa,
I know they're gonna lay down the law.
About the honky tonk blues,
Them jumpin' honkty tonk blues.
Lord I'm suffrin' with the honky tonk blues.
