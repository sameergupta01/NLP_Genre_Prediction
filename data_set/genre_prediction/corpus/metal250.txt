I am the healer and the deceiver

I am the sober eye of fate

I always take to be the giver

I am the crimson eye of hate



My love is sloth corrupting order

I am the secret hand of pain

I am the builder of this wanderland

My face is known by the insane



My work is black the sin moves

As horrific and as cold

I am the horns with golden hooves

The balance of the gods

Oblivion decay and death

Three of my children without birth



I am into the inner dark

The tension of the kill

The first of murders had my mark

I am in restricted thrills



My work is black the sin moves

As horrific and as cold

I am the horns with golden hooves

The balance of the gods

Not being me, yet I am life

The lover and the wife



In nothing I am the essence all, the things in which you exist

Still I am more you couldn't hold, the corpse's biggest feast

My work is black the sin moves as horrific and as cold

I am the horns with golden hooves, the balance of the god

...the balance of the god



Staring at me is a simple thing

But may affect you a lot

I am inside you in every thing

GOD'S OWN ETERNAL HOST



I am the healer and the deceiver

I am the sober eye of fate

I always take to be the giver

I am the crimson eye of hate

My love is sloth corrupting order

I am the secret hand of pain

I am the builder of this wanderland

My face is known by the insane



My work is black the sin moves

As horrific and as cold

I am the horns with golden hooves

The balance of the gods

I am the burning side of rules

The balance of the gods

The balance of the gods

The balance of the gods
