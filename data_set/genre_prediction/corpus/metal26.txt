
[Lyrics by Sven]

An Indomintable thirst to delve
And propagate my surgical addiction,
We have to see, we have to know
Calculus of a disorder
Intricate to my dismay...

Methodically I pursue
With rusty hooks and skews
Muscles are ripped from bones
Such an eloquent bliss, my irreverence, insatiable quest for "knowledge"
So many ways, aesthetic deeds to reset the boundaries of pain

Enumeration of cadavers
Casuistry mistaken for Clairvoyance
Epitome of human filth
A mirror of masochistic guilt incarnate
I excoriate
My endless carnage

Evisceration on demand, the emetic stench of human misery
A descent into euphoria, a genocide, the path I have to take
Miscalculated dysphoria, as I bear witness the hunger doesn't fade
I am a pathogenic mystery, a plague restored with rage

The overture, merely a glimpse of what death ensues
The overture, the ending of lives so quiescent
The overture, merely a glimpse of what science lingers
The overture, the opening to a bloodbath so impending
As life becomes...

... A reminiscence of carnal decadence, abhorrent tests
In a mouldy laboratory, hemoglobin extruded
From the retched putrid life
Forms ready at my grasp
A reminiscence of what used to be, abhorrent crud
In a mouldy laboratory, hemoglobin now obsolete
The atchaic abattoir, the dawn of omega

An Indomitable thirst to delve
And propagate my addiction,
We have to see, we have to know
Calculus of a sadistic disorder
Intricate to my dismay...

The first chapter in a bloody trail
The apparatus in process to dissect
We have to bleed, we have to rot
Calculus of human nature
Pathetic to my dismay...
