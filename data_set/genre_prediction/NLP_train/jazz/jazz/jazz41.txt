Hey baby
I'm living for you

Drifting on a memory
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Than with you, loving you

Day will make the way for night
All we need is candlelight
And a song, soft and long

Well, you'd like to think
We're alone with a love unlike no other
Sad to see, a new horizon
Slowly coming into view

I wanna be living
For the love of you
All that I'm giving
Is for the love of you

Lovely as a ray of sun
That touches me
When the morning comes
Feels good to me, my lovin' me
Yeah yeah yeah

Smoother than a gentle breeze
Flowing from my mind with ease
Soft as can be
Well, when you're loving me, ooh baby

Love to be, riding the waves of your love
Enchanted with your touch
It seems to me, we can sail together
In and out of mystery

I wanna be living
For the love of you
All that I'm giving
Is for the love of you

Paradise, I have to think
Can't feel as secure again
You're the key and this I see

Now and then I lose my way
Usin' words to try
And say what I feel

Oh yeah, your love is real
I might as well sign my name on a card
That's been sayin' better

See, time will tell
'Cause it seems that I've done
Just about all that I can do

I wanna be living
For the love of you
All that I'm giving
Is for the love of you

I wanna be living
For the love of you
All that I'm giving
Is for the love of you

I wanna be living
For the love of you
All that I'm giving
Is for the love of you

I wanna be living
For the love of you
All that I'm giving
Is for the love of you
