

I might have been a singer
Who sailed around the world
A gambler who wins millions
And spent it all on girls

I might have been a poet
Who walked upon the moon
A scientist who'd tell the world
I'd discovered something new

I might have loved a king
And been the one to end a war
A criminal who drinks champagne
And never could be caught

But among your books, among your clothes
Among your noise and fuss, I've let it go

I can stop and catch my breath
And look no further for happiness
I will not turn again
Cos my heart has found its home

Everyone I'll never meet
And the friends I won't now make
The adventures that there could have been
And the risks I'll never take

But among your books, among your clothes
Among your noise and fuss, I've let it go

I can stop and catch my breath
And look no further for happiness
And I will not turn again
Cos my heart has found its home
