
Almost forgot, started to say
Rode into the sun past everyone
Hallelujah
Pretty Mary K

Found faith in the infirmary
There's a soldier lying in bed
With a wound to the head
Calling out to pretty Mary K

Here's what you get
For things that haven't happened yet

Happened upon pretty Mary K
But a soldier's uniform waved you away
I walk around the door and talk to St. James
Though I'm already done and ask everyone

Have you seen her?
Pretty Mary K
Have you seen her?
Pretty Mary K
