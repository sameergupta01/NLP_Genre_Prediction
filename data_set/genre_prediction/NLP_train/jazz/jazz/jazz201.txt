
I mistook the warnings for wisdom
from so-called friends quick to advise
though your touch was telling me otherwise
Somehow I saw you as a weakness
I thought I had to be strong
Oh but I was just young I was scared
I was wrong

Not a night goes by 
I don't dream of wandering through the home that might have been
I listened to my pride when my heart cried out for you 
Now everyday I wake again
In a house that might've been
A home

Guess I did 
What I did believing
that love is a dangerous thing
Oh but that couldn't hurt anymore
than never knowing

Not a night goes by
I don't dream of wandering 
through the home that might have been
I listened to my pride
when my heart cried out for you
Now everyday I wake again 
In a house that might've been 
A home
A home.....

four walls, a roof, a door, some windows
just a place to run when my workin day is through
they say home is where the heart is
if the exception proves the rule I guess that's true

Not a night goes by
I don't dream of wandering 
through the home that might have been
I listened to my pride
When my heart cried out for you
now everyday I wake again
In a house that might've been
A home a home
