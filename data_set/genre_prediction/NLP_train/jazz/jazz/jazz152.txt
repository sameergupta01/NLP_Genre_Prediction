
I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
I get a kick out of you?

I get no kick from cocaine
I'm sure if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrificly too
But I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to me
You obviously don't adore me

I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
But I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to me
You obviously don't adore me

I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
But I get a kick out of you
