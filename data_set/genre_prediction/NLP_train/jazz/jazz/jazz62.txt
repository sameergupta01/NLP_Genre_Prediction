
Seven years and twenty days
Since my spaceship skipped its course
Floating in oblivion
Without objective, without source
Memories dwindle, colours fade
Suspended in the eternal light
Shrivelling muscles, shrinking bones
Moving at the speed of fright

The mind begins to blur (amnesia)
The speech begins to slur (amnesia)
Complexion turns to grey
Desire fades away

Astrud Astronette
Under the star they will forget
Astrud Astronette

Laika was the first in space
Then Yuri came and took the spot
Neil first stumbled on the moon
I’m the first one they forgot

The mind begins to blur (amnesia)
The speech begins to slur (amnesia)
Complexion turns to grey
Desire fades away

Astrud Astronette
Under the star they will forget
Astrud Astronette
