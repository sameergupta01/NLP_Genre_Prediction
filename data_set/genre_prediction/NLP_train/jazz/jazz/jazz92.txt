
Go ahead baby,
run away again.
Growing tired of chasing you.
I know you only have time,
to love me.
You've got nothing better to do.

Who's bold enough to believe?
Even love or war..
Both just leave you busted,
and broken down.
Wanting more..

Baby, i've seen it all before.
Know that i've seen it all before.
Know that i've seen it all before.
I aint gonna be your fool any more.

I can hear my heart pounding,
oh but i can't decide.
Stuck between the depths of my fears,
and peaks of my pride.

Baby, i've seen it all before.
Know that i've seen it all before.
You know that i've seen it all before.
And I aint gonna be your fool any more.

Seen your tricks,
and i've seen your traitors.
I've seen your evil ways.
I've seen everything,
your twisted smile, 
conveying.

I ain't gonna be your fool baby
I ain't gonna be your fool baby
I ain't gonna be your fool baby
I ain't gonna be your fool baby
I ain't gonna be your fool baby
I ain't gonna be your fool baby
I ain't gonna be your fool baby
anymore..
