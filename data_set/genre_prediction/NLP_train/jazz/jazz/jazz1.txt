Chorus:
You've got to have an ace in the hole
A little secret that nobody knows
Life is a gamble a game we all play
but you need to save something for a rainy day
You've got to learn to play your cards right
If you expect to win in life
Don't put it all on the line for just one roll
You've got to have an ace in the hole

If you're headed down a one way street
and you're not sure its the way you wanna go
In money or love or all the above
Have a little more than what you show
When life deals out a suprise
Have a few suprises of your own
No matter what you do
No matter where you go
You've got to have an ace in the hole

(Chorus)

Don't put it all on the line just for one roll
You've got to have an ace in the hole

No matter what you do
No matter where you go
you've got to have an ace in the hole
