With a little luck
This old truck
Will get me home today
With a little more
I'll still have this job tomorrow
Weather man says
Wet weekend
He just might be right
But rain or shine
You'll be mine tonight.

Chorus:
That's all I need to know
In a world where most things come and go
I'll always have you to hold
That's all I need to know.

Heaven knows
I ain't even close
To being God's gift to women
But in your arms
I feel like I am
I don't know it all
I sure can't solve
The problems of the human race
But I know how to bring a smile
To your face.

Chorus:
That's all I need to know
In a world where most things come and go
I'll always have you to hold
That's all I need to know.

Darling
Say it one more time
You will forever be mine.

Chorus:
That's all I need to know
In a world where most things come and go
I'll always have you to hold
That's all I need to know.

I'll always have you to hold
That's all I need to know...
