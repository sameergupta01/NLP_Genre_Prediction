When I think of heaven
Deliver me in a black-winged bird
I think of flying
down into a sea of pens and feathers
and all other instruments of faith and sex and God
In the belly of a black-winged bird
Don't try to bleed me
cuz' I've been here before and I deserve a little more

I belong in the service of the Queen
I belong anywhere but in between
She's been crying , I've been thinking
And I am the Rain King

Well i said
Mama, mama, mama, why am I so alone?
I can't go outside
I'm scared I might not make it home
I'm alive, i'm alive
but I'm sinking in
If there's anyone at home at your place dalrin'
Why don't you invite me in?
Don't try to bleed me
I've been there before and I deserve a little more

I belong in the service of the Queen
I belong anywhere but in between
She's been lying
I've been sinking
And I am the Rain King

Hey, I only want the same as anyone
Henderson is waiting for the sun
Oh, it seems night endlessly begins and ends
After all the dreaming I come home again...

When I think of heaven
(Deliver me in a black-winged bird)
I think of dying
Lay me down in a field of flame and heather
Render up my body into the burning heart of
God in the belly of a black-winged bird
Don't try to bleed me
'cause I've been here before and I deserve a little more

I belong in the service of the Queen
I belong anywhere but in between
She's been dying
and I've been drinking and I am the Rain King.
well i said i am the rain king...
