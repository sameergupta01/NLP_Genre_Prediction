
She's riding on a crimson wave
Truth sat on her shoulder
Planets before melting face
The keys for the wounded
Sinking into underground
Please the one who wants it
Something is pulling you down
It's not the cravings why you need it

(pre-chorus)
It's a rush hour inside my head
Don't wanna share the anguish
And I will take it away from you
Before you can change it

(chorus)
That bastard hallucination's pushing me
Like a damned I walk over
Touch the sky when it's burning red 
Standing the ground I have chosen

Shivering in outer space
There's no one who can hear you
Getting into different state
It's like getting nowhere
Gathering all those fears and fails
There's no one who can see you
Someone is pulling you down
It's not the cravings why you need it

(pre-chorus)

(chorus)
