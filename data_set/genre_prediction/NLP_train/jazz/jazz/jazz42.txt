The time has come to say goodbye
I'm asking you to please don't cry
The time to me won't be so long
To know you're happy back at home

Someday we'll meet again sweetheart
We'll meet and never more to part
Someday we'll meet again sweetheart
Don't cry, so please don't break my heart

So goodbye now, don't be blue
Try to be happy and be true
And remember what I say
Sweetheart we'll meet again someday

Oh sweetheart I'm leaving now
Yes I'll soon be on my way
Each night upon my knees I pray
Sweetheart we'll meet again someday
