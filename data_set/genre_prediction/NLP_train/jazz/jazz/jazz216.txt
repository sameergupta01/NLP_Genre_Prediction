
Let's not make it into a big thing
Let's not get lost in this
I know it is, I know we could
I guess we surely would
Let's pretend it's not
It doesn't mean a thing


Let's not blow it out of all senses
As though it meant so much
It's always thought about for weeks
Not everytime your lips meet mine, I think of her
But when her hands reach out, I think of you
