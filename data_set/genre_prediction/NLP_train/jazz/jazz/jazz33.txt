Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh,

Black and orange stray cat sittin' on a fence
Ain't got enough dough to pay the rent
I'm flat broke but I don't care
I strut right by with my tail in the air


Stray cat strut, I'm a (ladies' cat),
A feline Casanova, (hey man, thats where its at)
Get a shoe thrown at me from a mean old man
Get my dinner from a garbage can

Yeah don't cross my path


I don't bother chasing mice around Oh no.
I slink down the alley looking for a fight
Howling to the moonlight on a hot summer night
Singin' the blues while the lady cats cry,
Wild stray cat, you're a real gone guy.
I wish I could be as carefree and wild,
but I got cat class and I got cat style.
