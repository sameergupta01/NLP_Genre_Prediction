
Wanna be by yourself and no-one else, alright. (al-al-al-al-alright)
And you wanna go out, wanna scream and shout tonight. (to-to-to-to-tonight)
You want some space, like get out of my face, alright. (al-al-al-al-alright)
and you want me back, put your life on track tonight. (to-to-to-to-tonight)

You're a needy girl, I can tell when I look in your big brown eyes.
You want my world, but how can I do yours if i can't do mine?
I try to change but somehow I always feel I don't feel the same.
It's all about what you want, what you say, how you feel, how you play the game.
You're a needy girl, and you want my world.
I try to change, knowing it's not the same.

''"Hello? Hey what's up baby. Yeah, I'm in the studio right now, I'll call you later. Nah, I really can't talk right now, I'll just call you back, alright? I-I can't talk right now, I'll just call you later. Yo, what? Yo, I can't, look.. Yo, whatever"''

When you're home alone, you don't answer the phone, alright. (al-al-al-al-alright)
But it's like a crime if I don't answer mine tonight. (to-to-to-to-tonight)
So you've found a man, who's more than a friend, alright. (al-al-al-al-alright)
But you still call me for TLC tonight. (to-to-to-to-tonight)
