
Cats are crying, gates are slammin'
The wind is howling 'round the house tonight
I'm as lonely as a boat out on the sea
When the night is black and the tide is high

Oh, on nights like these
Feel like falling to my knees
Feel like calling "heaven, please"

Find my love - Find my love
Find my love - Find my love

Oh, well, I turn the dial on my radio
trying to find an all-night station
Want to hear a song I know,
a song about my situation

Oh, on nights like these
Feel like falling to my knees
Feel like calling "heaven, please"

Find my love - Find my love
Find my love - Find my love

Somewhere out there, there must be a boy for this girl
Could be anywhere, could be next door, or the other side of the world!

Call up the radio, give 'em my number,
Tell them to put it out on the air
There must be someone, there must be someone like me
sitting lonely as a boat out there

Oh, on nights like these
Feel like falling to my knees
Feel like calling "heaven, please"

Find my love - Find my love
Find my love - Find my love
