
The dark wave came again last night
I want it all to end; I want the world to end

Every night, the dream is the same
I sit here waiting for the world to end, but it never ends
And everything I used to be has spiraled into insanity
Every night, I sweat and bleed in her name 

The dark wave comes, sanity slips away
She screams from the alcove, "I am the dog!"

She was born in the year of the dog
She never would betray the world I never saw
Blinded eyes that never see, shattered into infinity
Every night, the dream is the same

The dark wave comes, sanity slips away
She screams from the alcove, "I am the dog!"

Every night, the dream is the same
I suffer, wading through the endless waves of empty disdain
And everything I used to be has spiraled into insanity
Every night, I sweat and bleed in her name

The dark wave comes, sanity slips away
She screams from the alcove
The dark wave comes, sanity slips away
She screams from the alcove, "I am the dog...!"
