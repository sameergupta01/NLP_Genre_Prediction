
[Lyrics: Sven de Caluwé]

Oh! Alive?!

Vivified by the reek of depravity
A cesspool of existence
Emotive, I'm a wreck!

Breathing through a Test Tube
- Only to realize
Hooked to Apparatus
- Drilled into my core
Horrible muted stench,
With rotting flesh
I am adorn

Alive?
Or subsequently a function to maintain
In this cesspool of existence
Creative, I am a wreck!
On the frontier of insanity
Awoken now clearly my eyes see red
The Chondrin Enigma... Unfolds

Amputated
- Stumps of pounded beef
Consumed - Sodomite cheeks in a composting brew
Amputated
- Festering pounded meat
Consumed - Extracted malformations secrete

Kept alive,
To service in servitude like a shriveling mess
This gangrenous hive
Ignoramus in an obsolete status

And now I'm taking control
Gathering my scattered mess
And now I'm taking control
Bleeding the sepsis that cankers in me
Bleeding the cancer that is humanity
And extirpates it all...

Kept alive,
To service in servitude like a shriveling mess
This gangrenous hive
Ignoramus in an obsolete status

Breathing through a Test Tube
- Only to realize
Hooked to Apparatus
- Drilled into my core
Horrible muted stench,
With rotting flesh
I am adorn

Alive?
Or subsequently a function to maintain
In this cesspool of existence
Abrasive, I am a wreck!
On the frontier of morality
Deceased now clearly my eyes bled dry
The Chondrin Enigma... Appends
Ya!
