
Foreboding fear trickles down the spine
Into the pool, resonating
Behind the wall the dreamer lies in velvet sleep
She must be still, never make a sound

Awake. . . . . .awaken the dreamer
Awake. . . . . .awaken
Awake. . . . . .awaken the dreamer
Awake. . . . . .where are you my love?

We build our walls around our games
We decompose, dreamers never really die
She lies unknown, the cenotaph in her name

Awake. . . . . .awaken the dreamer
Awake. . . . . .awaken
Awake. . . . . .awaken the dreamer
Awake. . . . . .where are you my love?

She lies unknown
She lies unknown
She lies unknown
She lies unknown
She hides
