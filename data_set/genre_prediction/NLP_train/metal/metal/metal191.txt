

Today, the warning came in the flood
Architects and fools never 
Cared for poor men's blood
Cursed to repeat the past, they are
The river dragon swims upstream
They've built another wall

The three will fall
Save us from the flood
Washed away, we drown
Three will fall

The river dragon has come
Souls wash away
The Earth has spoken 
And taken them to their graves

Those who cannot remember the last
Fall away, far away
The distance meets its task

The three will fall
Save us from the flood
Washed away, we drown
Three will fall

The river dragon has come
Souls wash away
The Earth has spoken 
And taken them to their graves
The river dragon has come
At first light of dawn
The Earth has spoken
And in the crush, they are gone

The three will fall
Save us from the flood
Washed away, we drown
Three will fall

The river dragon has come
Souls wash away
The Earth has spoken 
And taken them to their graves
In the mass destruction, 
The bringer shows his form:
Technology, the beast
The seventh crown
