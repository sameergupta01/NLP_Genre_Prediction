
[Lyrics by Niek / Sven]

Drastic surgery of the female anatomy
Artificial impediment of fecundity
Evisceration of the reproductive viscera
Impending mutilation of the brood inside

The patient: Incise my womb
Deprive me of potential progenies
Never to breed again
Despoiled of descendants
Incise my cavities
Never to hemorrhage again

Abounded with mongrels
This dusty realm must be cleansed
Ritual slaying of the sceptic source of this infection

My inner tomb
A final resting place for progenies
Never to breed again
Despoiled of gangrene
Sanguine abasement befalls
Never to breed again

A virulent soup of menstrual gore
Eve's curse reversed into a trail of guts
Bringing an end to the depravity mistaken for humanity

Abounded with mongrels
This dusty realm must be cleansed
Ritual slaying of the sceptic source of this infection

Incise my womb
Deprive me of potential progenies
Never to breed again
Despoiled of descendants
Incise my cavities
Never to hemorrhage again

Internal abdomen exposed - a sanguinary void
The final solution of humanity set
Public castration by the hands of thyself
Excise the infection of human filth
Parturition of genital waste

Urethral carnage - aberrant gynaecol
The spaying séance
