All this life shrouded in a veil
Of deception in association
But now
I will witness thee
With unblinding open eyes

Judas I bury you in your own blood
You only held me down from what I was suppose to be

Ascend above the ashes of the world I once knew

Judas I bury you in your own blood
You only held me down from what I was suppose to be

Ascend above the ashes of the world I once knew
Ascendancy is the only thing this will prove

I spread the fuel with fire
Desire
To incinerate all
Behold I rise
phoenix, phoenix!

Ascend above the ashes
Ascend above it all (x2)
