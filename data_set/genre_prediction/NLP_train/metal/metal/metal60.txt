
High heels of crystal
Stuck in the heart
Daylight that heals
The full moon scars
Spider strategy
And the wish to be
At one with me
Throughout the fright

It is so real
So full of light (when)
Nocturna steals the night

Sister of Cain
All our breed slain
The youthful oath
Remains the same
Le mal de vivre
That never ends 
But the hunt (for you) goes on
Throughout the night

It is so real
So full of light (when)
Nocturna steals the night
