Hideous louse!
The face deformed by horror,
By the fear of life's duties,
By the anguish of the unknown

-Born in blood and tears
-You'll bleed and cry when the day you die

Welcome to the world of the living
Here's your supreme punishment
Look at the wound of life
That only death will be able to heal

Oh! Bulged tummy women
Oh! Deformed body women
From your filthy womb
It's death to whom you give birth

Hideous louse!
The face deformed by horror,
By the fear of the nothingness of death
By the anguish of the unknown

Welcome to the kingdom of the dead
Here's your promised reward
Looks on you to close again
The great vagina of the earth
