
seperate but one
is how we exist
like fingers and thumbs
together a fist
ready to strike
in daylight or night
for our right to party
we gonna fight
we want to play
so get in the way
you'll be destroyed
it's your hell to pay

cannonball - gonna tell you who you are messin' with
cannonball - original skate party clique
cannonball - blowing spots like a terrorists
cannonball

rolling together
watch out you better
protect your home
defend your scene
mess with the dogs
you get the teeth
new jack vikings
the hijacking team

cannonball - now I'll tell you who you are messin' with
cannonball - original skate party clique
cannonball - blowing spots like a terrorists
cannonball - we be the skate punk anarchists

fired at you like a cannonball
we're a wild tribe filled by alcohol
go of the roof with a cannonball
emptying your pools
we gonna skate the walls
oh oh oh cannonball

we came, we saw - conquered it all
broke down the walls go cannonball
