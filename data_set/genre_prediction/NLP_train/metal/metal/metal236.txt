Disintegration constituents to decompose of the parts
A malformation utopia systematic unity can't be achieved
Be numb to all the things
That force you to frame

We are the deceived
Lost in the foreseen

To wait for aforementioned dreams time will only tell
Tell that the promised have been failed
Behold your fellow man through centuries of control
Adhering to the decrees of a manufactured god
