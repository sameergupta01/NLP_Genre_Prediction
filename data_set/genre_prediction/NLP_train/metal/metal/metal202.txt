

Slithering slow and serpentine coiled around your spine
My willing victim so sublime, one taste and you are mine

Did you remember to feed me while I was broken and bleeding?

Preaching words obsidian on the wings of shattered man
The sightless wait oblivious to the scourge that stains their hands
All you feel and all you do, the medication controls you

Did you remember to feed me while I was broken and bleeding?

Now slap your vein
I'm the power of pain and pleasure symbiotic, I am, I am
I'm a medicated nation of blind neurotics, I am, I am
Psychotic pain baptized in pure narcotics, I am, I am

Did you remember to feed me while I was broken and bleeding?

Trapped in dark seductive miracles, defied addictive rituals
All you feel and all you do, the medication controls you

Did you remember to feed me while I was broken and bleeding?

Now slap your vein
I'm the power of pain and pleasure symbiotic, I am, I am
I'm a medicated nation of blind neurotics, I am, I am
Psychotic pain baptized in pure narcotics, I am, I am

All you feel and all you do, the medication controls you
