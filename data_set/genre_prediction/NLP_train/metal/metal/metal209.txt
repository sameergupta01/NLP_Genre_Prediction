

Send yourself to get back night
I see women crawl
It's dusty and mid in mind
This is my intention

I smell the gasoline
I smell the fire
I'll make it all so clear
This is my mentor

I've seen me set the light
This is the mentor
I met cold on this ride
This is the centre

Smell the gasoline
I light the fire inside
Smell the gasoline
I sway all through the night

Don't let it fall
You're not you, you're me
Boo
Don't let it get a taste of your blood
Yeah you're feeling small
Don't look at me, don't look at me
You're dancing with the Devil in my hall

Now am I lost?
Deep in my soul, there will be no forever
Through time I'm tossed
A wish without hope, into the never

As time stands still
My spirit grows cold
I fall into darkness
As black as my soul

Crawl for your master
You know I'm in control

Smell the gasoline
I light the fire inside
Smell the gasoline
I sway all through the night

Don't let it fall
Don't let it get a taste of your blood
Don't let it fall
You're kissing with the Devil in my hall

Now am I lost?
Deep in my soul, there will be no forever
Through time I'm tossed
A wish without hope, into the never

As time stands still
My spirit grows cold
I fall into darkness
As black as my soul

Now am I lost?
Without hope into the never
Deep in my soul
