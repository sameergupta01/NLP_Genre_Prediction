
Again it poured over me in waves. 
When she left with them she said I must 
break free from the dark. I tried to tell her 
of their poison, she chose not to hear. 
She was never seen again" 

Sometimes when I'm alone I still feel you 
Your breath on my neck, you're still with me 
And I'm still dreaming neon black 
I wait for you, to taste your unknown world 
The clock spins to time that must mean nothing 

Meet me in the dreamtime water, drown 
Shifting shaping currents flow in memory 
swim through me 
Meet me in the drowning pool of tears 
And wash away my innocence and fear 

Sometimes I wonder where you are, can you feel my tears? 
I never knew what changed you 
Did they paint your dreams in pale shades? 
I wait for you, you know you cannot hide 
Division from within invalidates suffering 

Meet me in the dreamtime water, drown 
Shifting shaping currents flow in memory 
swim through me 
Meet me in the drowning pool of tears 
And wash away my innocence 
I am a child of light living in your mind 
The pain, the unknowing washes away in time 
Until then will you meet me whenever I call to you? 

I am a child of light living in your mind 
The pain, the unknowing washes away in time 
Until then will you meet me whenever I call to you? 

Meet me in the dreamtime water, drown 
Shifting shaping currents flow in memory 
swim through me 
Meet me in the drowning pool of tears 
and wash away my innocence 

I am a child of light living in your mind 
The pain, the unknowing washes away in time 
Until then will you meet me whenever I call to you? 

Meet me in the dreamtime water, drown 
Shifting shaping currents flow in memory 
swim through me 
Meet me in the drowning pool of tears 
and wash away my innocence 

I am a child of light living in your mind 
The pain, the unknowing washes away in time 
Until then will you meet me whenever I call to you? 

Meet me in the dreamtime water, drown 
Shifting shaping currents flow in memory 
swim through me 
Meet me in the drowning pool of tears 
and wash away my innocence 
Meet me in the dreamtime water, drown 
Shifting shaping currents flow in memory 
swim through me 
Meet me in the drowning pool of tears 
And wash away my innocence 
Meet me 

My only cure won't you meet me? 
In the drowning pool of fate the moon and the sun still wait 
Won't you meet me? 
I suffer silently for our love, the jester has lost his dove
