

Billion lights burn the dark
Universe open wide
From sky to sky we climb up
More and more it will never stop
Ambition shines like sun
In our heart, in you our eyes
Speculation rules the game
All for sex, money and fame
Now every night I dream about the ride
Got a stair need a horse with over-sized wings
Conquer to conquer
Conquer...conquer it all
Clash of prayers in electric sea
I stand like a tower stronger than me
All is full of power for those who can see
Don't believe the liars who don't want you to be
Now every night I dream about the ride
Billion lights burn the dark
Universe open wide
From sky to sky we climb up
More and more it will never stop
Now every night I dream about the ride
Got a stair need a horse with over-sized wings
Conquer to conquer
Conquer...conquer it all
Conquer to conquer
Conquer...conquer it all
conquer it all, conquer it all
