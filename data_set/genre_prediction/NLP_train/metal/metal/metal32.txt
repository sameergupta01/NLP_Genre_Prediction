
Life - medicated - detruncated

Unsatisfied... urges from within
Dark chasms of reality
My life runs on empty

Superior? Or inferior?
No matter, you're all just cattle
My cup runneth over....

I reek your depravity
Feed on your sciolism

Ritual cleansing; set to the fore
Absurd to many; regulating my life
Perpetual mayhem; set to the gore
Purity in murder I am

Perversion? Damnation
In a gray zone of decadence I reside
I feed on the scorned

Mysoginic abomination
With scalpel and blade I demonstrate
The beauty of madness

With surgical precision their lives come to an end
Stainless, emotionless
The darkness in me

Pestiferous subterfuge
The hollow inside, the darkness in me

Unsatisfied... urges from within
Benine spasms related to the kill
My life runs on empty

Superior? Or inferior?
No matter, you're all just cattle
My cup runneth over....

Flesh: but a canvas for me to sculpt at will
Medicated, detruncated
Humanity a shitstain to be removed

Pestiferous subterfuge
The hollow inside, the darkness in me
Pestiferous subterfuge
Depicting remains of humanity...
