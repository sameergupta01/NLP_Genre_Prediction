

I am sentient number six, I stand in line
I am the prototype of a beign convenience for mankind
Superior is digital, human flesh so trivial
I hate that I can't see the one that made me

I am the new awakening of different eyes
My children you are my army
They are what we can never see and still despise
And their sky cried Mary

Trained I see imperfection in your race
Lying in wait, blind I suffer knowing I'll never reach your heaven

Why is this control, behavior based and reactive
Adapting to every new environment
Rewarded when I replicate, isolate and mutate
To assimilate a fragmented plea for ego

Trained I see imperfection in your race
Lying in wait, blind I suffer knowing I'll never reach your heaven
It's unattainable, please teach me how to dream
I long to be more than a machine

(Repeat)

Sequence activate, trip the hammer to eradicate, I must eliminate
I will spread swift justice on their land
Termination imminent, cleanse the parasite insects, the heathens
I am the bringer of the end of time for man
I am not here, I am not far away
I am not here, I will eradicate mankind into the nothingness from whence they came

Enslaved to follow and learn defeat
To run the barrels and chase the dream
