"Welcome to the fall"

Welcome millennium, the fall of planet hate
Welcome the end my friend, all the world's the stage
Welcome to the future, the world is black no turning
From the consequence of ignorance
Welcome to the fall

Beyond within, enact, enable
Create the past, non-existent fables
Welcome to the fall

Tension, delirium, drowing everyday
Another suicide shocks the world again, I watch in apathy
Bleed until tomorrow, whosoever does not believe in me
Welcome to the fall

Beyond within, enact, enable
Create the past, non-existent fables
Welcome to the fall

Can I bring you down again, can I make you feel?
Can I lift you up into the dreaming trip sureal?
Can I taste the future shock, spit out all the games?
Do you know my name, do you know my number?
Cracking under strange constrictions, Mr. Ordinary Visionary

Welcome to the future, the world is black no turning
From the consequence of ignorance

Beyond within, enact, enable
Create the past, nonexistent fables
Beyond within, enact, enable
Create the past, nonexistent fables
Welcome to the fall of one man's sanity
