
Callous aberrations pour into my mind
I perceive, I bleed
Yet all facets of existence are absent in me
A myriad of dissilience, void of contempt
Slithering through life like a lecherous mongrel, a parasite

I deface the norm
The shell from which you are born

Avarice of vilification, distorted and skewed
The degrading of vermin an intoxicating brew
Human emotion a burden I gladly trade
Merely collateral to my relentless rage

Carelessly torn asunder
Pushed to a corner, phrenetic lash-back
Pulled down under, societal misfit
Callousness taking control
Tremendous rancour
I demonstrate my grand desperation

Dedicated to corrupt life
A castigation junkie, anomaly
Distort and nullify
Proactive in perpetuate slander

Can't restrict from this urge to deride
Can't resist the impulse to vilify

Tremendous rancour
Callousness taking control
I demonstrate my grand desperation

Dedicated to corrupt life
A castigation junkie, anomaly
Distort and nullify
Proactive in perpetuate slander

Avarice of vilification
