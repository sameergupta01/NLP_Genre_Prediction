

Emulous life form emerges, and slashes continuously
A man made predator slides back moral, self censored reality

Crushing through my veins
Coagulating awareness
Chromosomes regressed
With the saw, I shall purge
Taking the next step,
The robbing of life
Anticipating blood flow
Feelings of contempt arise

No longer in control, I crave the dead
One with the dead, I am

A prophetized death machine, unleashed
Bones are splintered as I saw, decadence to feed
Murder is mankind's only saviour, Goremageddon...

Sawing up stiffs to my every need
Decadence to feed
Feeding, and preying on man
To cleanse the world, decandence exceeds

Emulous life form emerges
And slashes repeatedly
A man-made predator feeding
On its own creator, your society

Feeding, and preying on man, to cleanse the world
Decadence exceeds
Sawing up stiffs to my every need
Decadence to feed
