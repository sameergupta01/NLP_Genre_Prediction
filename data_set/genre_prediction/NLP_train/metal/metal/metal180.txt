

Learning ways to fly
Just never too high to die
Pushing limits into the ground
Until I never come down
Burning through lifetimes without form
Pure energy, I am the shattered norm

I'm the lost one chasing colors to the sun
Colors bleed but never fade
I'll just fade away

To swim these sentient seas
Windows into eternity
Never afraid to scale the wall
The lunatic never falls
Forfeiture of reality seeds sown
Constructure of this path is not my own

I'm the lost one chasing colors to the sun
Colors bleed but never fade
I'll just fade away
Why should I come down?
From here I can see forever

I'm the lost one chasing colors to the sun
Colors bleed but never fade
I'll just fade away

Remember in the end
Such a long strange trip it's been
So I sing this song
For the lost one
Why should I come down?
From here I can see forever
Forever
I can see forever
I can see
