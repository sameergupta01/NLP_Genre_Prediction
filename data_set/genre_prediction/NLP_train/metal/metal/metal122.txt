
I don't even hear what you say
It's all about what you do
You think you're the mack
I'll tell you a fact
No-one gives a fuck about you 

What it is
What is was
And what you always will be
Think
You think you're my friend
You ain't my friend 

I hear you talking about respect and clout
You never get a bit
A front or a back
We're gonna smack
Time to flip the script on you kid
