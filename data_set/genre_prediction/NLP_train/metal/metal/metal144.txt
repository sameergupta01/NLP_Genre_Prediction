

It's time to play a game
A game of chances
And now recall the names
Of those who passed before us

Today you could lose your life
Do as you're told, toe the line
Hypocrisy is what we die for
Cattle to the slaughter born, are we?

All the cowards hide
As their puppets dance, they laugh
They pull the strings

It's time to play your hand
The cards have been dealt
Atone the sins of man
And cleanse your spirit

Do what they say, surrender will
And you won't go to Hell
A human pawn of suited cowards
There is no truth, only power

All the cowards hide
As their puppets dance, they laugh
They pull the strings

All the pawns resign
To the wheel of chance
They watch the wheel spin
No one wins

Fall, obey, another number meets the end

All the cowards hide
As their puppets dance, they laugh
They pull the strings

All the pawns resign
To the wheel of chance
They watch the wheel spin

All the pious lies
We subvert the minds of youth
To lead them to truth

All the pawns resign
The appointed fools 
Oppress our worthless generation

Fall, obey, another number meets the end
Obey, obey, obey
Fall, obey, another number meets the end
Pray, you're saved
Your hidden past is the last laugh
Obey
