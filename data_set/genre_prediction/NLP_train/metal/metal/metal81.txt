
Opium,desire or will?
Inspiration bound from a elegant seed.
Subversion,through smoke I foresee,
Erotic motions of lesser gods in ecstasy.

Opium, bring me forth another dream.
Spawn worlds of flesh and wrath,
Little jewels of atrocity.
Opium, I sleep in debauchery,
And burn with you,
When you burn in Me.

Opium, we fantasize,
As we fuse with your root,
You are a strange flower,
We are your strangest fruit.

Opium,it burns in me and you.
Opium,it burns for me and for you.

"Por isso tomo ópio. É um remédio.
Sou um convalescente do Momento.
Moro no rés do chão do Pensamento
E ver passar a vida faz-me tédio."
