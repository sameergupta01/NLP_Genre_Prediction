
As the sun gains its whole brightness
As the earth vibrated on a higher level
Bridge from sky to earth will consolidate
Life will avoid all punishments
The earth will shine
The earth will radiate
The sky will no more
The moon will turn on
We'll discovered our other face
We'll enter the dark side
We'll travel every people's mind
We'll understand the one we all where once
The dark side...the dark side...
No one will ever be judged
No one will ever be punished
Rebel angels fly while other people walk
Worshipers and other losers, victims of ignorance and naivety
Will remain prisoner of their carnal form
And forever serve who they all mean to be
