
"What has been put asunder
shall again be whole"

In this neon black gloom I still see her face
She comes to me bringing darkest hour, I am forlorn
The pain is reborn

You are forever in my heart you never died
You are forever I still wonder where you are

I know you're dreaming, I know you're at peace
I'll meet you in the dreamtime
Whenever you call me I'll go under, I'll swim through you

You are forever in my heart you never died
You are forever I still wonder where you are
I know you're dreaming neon black

"As the curtain calls, and the cast recedes,
I am all that ever was and all that ever will be.
In wither and repose this frayed chapter
now does close, and fade into neon black"
