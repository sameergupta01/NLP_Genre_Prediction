
A misanthropic vision – apathy is omnipresent...
All I see is a congregation of crud...
A waste of space serving none but my cravings

A delicate selection of the tools of my trade
All shall fall with a thrust of steel
Hammer at hand, blunt force trauma impending

A ritual concoction – with a slight hint of insanity
Your utopic society lies awash, no standards, no morals
Only grime remains – a monument of integrity
Only grime remains

Decrepit and stale, only picturesque remnants of your salivating ignorance
You all stare into a bottomless pit, with a cracking sound I relieve this earth from another piece of shit

A misanthropic vision – apathy is omnipresent...
A waste of space serving none but my cravings

A delicate selection of the tools of my trade
All shall fall with a thrust of steel
Hammer at hand, blunt force trauma impending

Timeless wonder, the moldy scent of blood
Soothing silence, the destruction of your world
Timeless wonder, the omnipresence of death
Soothing silence, the destruction of your world

I just had to destroy something beautiful
Scraping cranial matter, a picturesque view of it all
Is this hysteria? Human nature at its purest form

For all I care call me obscene
And pretend to live your life pristine
Rancor fed those like me grow
To feed until there is nothing to show

A ritual concoction – with a slight hint of insanity
A sensible inheritance – the destruction of decency
Standing in a pool of blood - the remnants of my bidding
