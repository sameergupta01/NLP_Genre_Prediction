
[Lyrics by Sven]

Partaking studies of what death was supposed to be
Irreversible - chemical reality
Revive the dead into a haze of gore and guts
Incessant miscreants, to chew on those I abhor

The Nucleus of resurrection
Enthral the dead in my collection...
Of masticated rot
The nucleus of resurrection
One with the dead

Conclude the formula to erase the final barrier
Raise the stiffs, kill the living
Contagious levels sullied my virtuous claim
Irresponsible - morgue set ablaze

The nucleus of resurrection
Legions of parasites incubated
Voracios war, set to the fore
Appalling butchery, the animate exhale no more

Partaking studies of what death was supposed to be
Irreversible - chemical reality
Revive the dead into a haze of gore and guts
Incessant miscreants, to chew on those I abhor

The Nucleus of resurrection
Enthral the dead in my collection....
Voracious war, set to the fore
Appalling butchery, the animate exhale no more
