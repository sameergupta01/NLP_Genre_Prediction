Lay back baby and we'll do this right
There's blankets in back we can use
I'll start the car, but we'll stay in park
The cold can kill us before fumes

Now's the right time for a good song
Get something to say what I can't
Do you feel bad, like I feel bad?
We'll pour us a road, we'll both drink and drive

Kiss me with your cherry lipstick
Never wash you off my face
Hit me I can take your cheap shots
Leave you with the love we made

Come alive on the driver's side
So close I taste your breath
Your lips go dry, but they're sweet inside
The wine must go right to your head
It'd be easy if you get mad
But three fingers point back to you
We could stay here
Stay here all night
No one will know us and the moonlight

Kiss me with your cherry lipstick
Never wash you off my face
Hit me, I can take your cheap shots
Leave you with the love we made

I set my watch by street side clock
Needle in nickel groove
You pierce my heart like a willing arm
Your ticking makes my blood move
There's no way out this fade out
Be Happy to Get what you do
Make you notice with Purpose
'Cause quitting alone will never get you dry

Never get you dry

Give me everything you got now
I don't feel a single thing
Drag me out into the cold rain
Let it hover over me

Kiss me with your cherry lipstick
Never wash you off my face
Hit me, I can take your cheap shots
Leave you with the love we made

Hit me, I can take your cheap shot
Leave you with the love we made

Hit me, I can take your cheap shot
Leave you with the love we made
