
let me tell you a story (a true story)
about a woman I know (boy what you know?)
when it come to loving (that good good lovin')
she's so for sure (and good to go)
you ain't exactly pretty nah (tell 'em boy)
not exactly smart
but
let me tell you the truth
not lying to you
that's the girl who stole my heart
yo!

help police
stop that thief
she stole my lovin'
now I'm incomplete
she left tracks
put scratches on my back
tore the dog up
like an alley cat woman
beware of that woman
get out of my life
and never come back
what the hell was I thinking?
know I was drinking
drunk like a pirate
while my ship was sinking

so was she fun lovin'?
she left me with something
a whole lot of nothing
where you been?
was a hell of a time
nearly blew my mind
fun lovin'
besides the shame
only know the name
Rosalyn
yeah! yeah! yeah!

could a been location (bad situation)
might a been the booze (too many brews)
was it the moonshine (that made you blind?)
or the full moon (don't blame the moon)
now is this the crossroads (lord have mercy)
moment of trouth - you see
I'd go astray
drifted my way
right down to the delta blues

I met her at the dog track
damn she looked fat
bet it all on her
she took my heart bank and back
she said thank you for the good time
now that I will be that
I've had enough of you
so could you please extract
and hit the road jack
don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more
I'm a ho Jack
so don't you come back no more

so was she fun lovin'?
