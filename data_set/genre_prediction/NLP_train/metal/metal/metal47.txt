Drool dripping out my tongue hanging south saliva flowing free
my eyes full of lust my balls gonna bust give yourself to me
thirst I can't quench c'mere you wench there's something that I need

Carnivore
I'm a meat eater
Carnivore
I'd like to meet ya
Carnivore
I know I'll reach ya

The hunger I feel makes you a meal oh girl you sure taste sweet
by my hair pull me there guide me to your treat
spread your legs I'll seed your eggs oh, feel me deep

Chorus

Lick me she begged she pulled down my head I love to eat pussy
a taste so fine like sweet april wine I won't trade for any money
did you cum I eat and run I live for sodomy
