

Inside four walls, I live my life
Doesn't matter what I've done:
The Government's always right

They tell us what to be
They tell us what to believe
They're wrong, my friend is gone

Inside four walls
Inside four walls
The day they took away my friend

Injustice made its mark
All the political whores only come out after dark
If anyone knows the way
Build me a bridge so I won't fall astray

Inside four walls, inside four walls, my friend
They took away your freedom
And the pigs still preach their lies

The system falls apart
The pigs still laugh, feeding off our broken lives
Can anyone tell me why
Some violent criminals do far less time?

Inside four walls, inside four walls, my friend
They took away your freedom
And the pigs still preach their lies

Inside four walls, inside four walls, my friend
They took away your freedom
But they'll never take your mind
