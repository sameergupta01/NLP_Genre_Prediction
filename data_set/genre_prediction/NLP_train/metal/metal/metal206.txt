
Clock strikes 6
Nothing matters anymore
I was struck down
From another bothered head I see it
One more day
I want to hear
This is not a matter to begin
Laugh again - laugh again
You're my friend - and... me

Yeah
One more day
Nothing matters anymore

There's a moonlight for her
Life is addictive and alike... him
There is a warning after
There is a dawn in
My darling at night
Everyone is here

Wait for the clock striking now
In the sweet - in the loving air
I love the way you look tonight
You are beautiful my dear
Your fear you'll give
So close
To the border
I stand in water
Waiting for your eyes to open

Sleeping beauty
It's time to wake
Lock your sun down
Cast your smile away
Sleeping beauty
We are so deeply bound
Haunted by our obsession
In darkness we drown

Standing tall
My shadow shields two halves of a puzzle
Incomplete without a fit
I see us
Yeah

And section x amazes me
Want it to be
Every day - every morning to life... and
There is a sunrise waiting for you
In this extraordinary life
An extraordinary life
To the border
I stand in water
Waiting for your eyes to open

Sleeping beauty
It's time to wake
Lock your sun down
Cast your smile away
Sleeping beauty
We are so deeply bound
Haunted by our obsession
In darkness we drown

She's awake

"Dominus Inflammatio"
"Obscurum Possessiones"

Yes my love... you found me
