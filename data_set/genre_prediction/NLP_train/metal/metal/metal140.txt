

I am the poet, the prophet in the pit 
Like a hollow-point bullet 
Straight through the head, I never miss you 

Within the dark communion of self-awareness 
There lies a void called "ego" 
An endless fusion of stillness and chaos
To bring its death can bring rebirth 

I want to freeze the time 
Dissolve into gray 
As we disintegrate the light 
Dissolve into gray 

Let the rain come down
Let the solitude surround

I want to change the lines 
Dissolve into gray 
And purify the divide 
Dissolve into gray 

Are we ever free
Or slaves to technology? 

Outside the fallen walls of pride and prejudice,
There is a voice that speaks in circles 
Empty illusions still fall before us
There is no future, so profess your pain 

I want to freeze the time 
Dissolve into gray 
As we disintegrate the light 
Dissolve into gray 

Let the rain come down 
Let the solitude surround 

I want to change the lines 
Dissolve into gray 
And purify the divide 
Dissolve into gray 

Are we ever free 
Or slaves to technology?
