

Black hole, black hole
Quest of grail, loss of sanctuary
Through the wheel, all is infinity
Immortal, the flame that keeps us up
Infernal, the time we lost in vain

I've been waiting all my life for this to come
This brand new world is where I want to live
I've been waiting all my life for this to come
This brand new world is where I want to...

Everything is up to something
Underneath your blackest emotions
Far above your brightest wishes
Stands a world for you to hold

Black hole, black hole
I've been waiting all my life for this to come
This brand new world is where I want to live
Through the wheel, all is infinity
Immortal, the flame that keeps us up
Infernal the time we lost in vain

Black hole, black hole
I've been waiting all my life for this to come
This brand new world is where I want to...
I've been waiting all my life for this to come
This brand new world is where I want to...
I've been waiting all my life for this to come
This brand new world is where I want to live
