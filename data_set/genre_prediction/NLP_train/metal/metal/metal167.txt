
Sometimes, it's so hard to show the way you feel
Sometimes, it seems like the words aren't real
Sometimes, it makes no difference what you're trying to say
When all the words come out wrong anyway

I've said too many words 
To catch them all in time
I've used the hurting words 
That took away your shine

Sometimes, you can't keep from falling in
Obscuring waters; against the stream, we swim
Sometimes, I feel like drowning just to make you say
All of the words you never want to say to me now

I've said too many words to catch them all in time
I've used the hurting words that took away your shine
I've said too many words to make you understand and see
There's far too many things that you and I can't say

Sometimes, it's so hard to show the way you feel
Sometimes, you know the words you say aren't real
Sometimes, I hate myself for hating things in you
And there's no words to heal; heal all my wounds now
