
Who is the one that don't need a gun
Livin' with the scum in the city slums
Mixin' with the players, bushers and bums
Keepin' it groovy with everyone
Out on the block is where the action's hot
They keep it moving and it just won't stop
The wolves in sheep's clothes, good people with hope
When it's DOG EAT DOG, they go for the throat 

I'm your Whateverman, that's just what I am
I'll help you if I can, to come through with your plan
Whateverman that's just what I am
I'll help you if I can to work it out 

Easy women and sleazy men
On Amsterdam Ave. and 110
The times are fast, the change is loose
Anything goes in the land of abuse 

I'm your Whateverman, that's just what I am
I'll help you if I can, to come through with your plan
Whateverman that's just what I am
I'll help you if I can to work it out
