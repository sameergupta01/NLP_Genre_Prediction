
Travel between a thousand legs
Taste hundreds of lips
Come over, slide inside again and again
Still heading for more, encore and encore
You know that you're alive
When you want more
I'm telling no lies
Don't fear the score
When the beast of our hearts
Speed it up our moves
It hurts so splendidly like a kiss
To an unreachable mouth
The rhythm of ecstasy
Mixes up our fluids
Like this...
You know that you're alive
When you want more
I'm telling no lies
Don't fear the score
Travel between a thousand legs
Taste hundreds of lips
Come over, slide inside again and again
Still heading for more, encore and encore
You know that you're alive
When you want more
I'm telling no lies
Don't fear the score
Again, again
Again, again, again, again
Again and again and again and again and
Again and again and again and .....Again!
