
My fetid obsession emerges at dusk
Roaming the streets
Releasing my 'humanity'
A colonic catastrophy

Cavilating this mephitic plot
A husk for my manure
Despoiling a life so pure
My colonic masterpiece

And so I impregnate
Skidmarks: the only proof of my didain

Sewing up the tool of my excess
Despoiled with rigid ordure
A walking hull of excrement

Mitigated by its own odor
The reek of chyme begins to infect
A congerie of crud is mine... to depict

As arteries bloat and congest
Your deteriorated mind begins to accept
Around you chest flies, begin to swarm
Behold, the carnal-mephitic war

As arteries bloat and congest
Your deteriorated mind begins to accept
Manipulated by my manure
Behold, the carnal-mephitic war

Purulent matter, my excess
The wrath of my pooper
A flatulent climax
My colonic masterpiece

The chyme congerie mine... to repent

And so I impregnate
Skidmarks: the only proof of my disdain

Purulent matter, my excess
The wrath of my pooper
A flatulent climax
My colonic masterpiece

The chyme congerie mine... to repent

And so I impregnate
Skidmarks: the only proof of my disdain

As arteries bloat and congest
Your deteriorated mind begins to accept
Larvae swarm where I once shat
Behold, the carnal-mephitic war

Deprecating matter ready to burst
A malodorous disasterpiece
My pernicious signature exposed
The chyme congeries

Despoiling a life so pure
My colonic masterpiece
