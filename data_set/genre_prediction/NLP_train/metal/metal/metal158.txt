
Time has no meaning for me. She is gone,
and the void speaks to me

You paint the sky in obsidian lies
And come what may never will I know how you changed time
The riptide lies ahead, all my passions now are dead
I can see the path you never thought to follow
I feel so hollow 

I stand before you, a shadow of a man
Behind these eyes self destruction swims through my mind
I'm confusion and contempt, I am the void
You are the emptiness of black tomorrow
I feel so hollow

You paint the sky in obsidian lies
And come what may never will I know how you changed time
The riptide lies ahead, all my passions now are dead
I can see the path you never thought to follow
I feel so hollow
You are diseased
You are deceiver
