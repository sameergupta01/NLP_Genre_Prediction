Look Me in the eyes and drown...

"Everyone considered the man in the blue jacket
As the most beautiful human being they have ever seen:
Nuns saw on him the Messiah in flesh
Satan's adorers the lustrous Prince of Darkness
Philosophers the Supreme Being
Young females an enchanted prince
Men an ideal reflection of themselves."

Patrick S skind: The Perfume ("Story Of An Assassin")

Look Me in the eyes and drown...

I am your vulture, your immoral sculpture
Mirrorman, who understands
I am you, I know you
Your fantasy and reality
I wait for you to welcome you in my dreamworld
My water-eyes

Look Me in the eyes
Touch me in the eyes and dream...
