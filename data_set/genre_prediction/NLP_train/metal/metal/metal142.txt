Can I be your personal demon
Sit back absorb the words
And feast on my mind semen
Can I be the devil on your shoulder
We all fall down as the world gets colder

I uncreate, I desecrate
I spit the truth into the engines of hate

Can I be your chemical pariah
The world's such an ugly place
It seems useless sometimes trying
Will you watch the hate machine spin evil
Or will you look away and plead apathy again

I uncreate, I desecrate
I spit the truth into the engines of hate

We sing into the sky on the production line
We are the holly swine,impurity defined
You can't ignore us anymore
You cannot judge us anymore

The sheep are made to follow
Choke back the puke and swallow
The sheep are told to divide
The engines of hate still grind

I uncreate, I desecrate
I spit the truth into the engines of hate
