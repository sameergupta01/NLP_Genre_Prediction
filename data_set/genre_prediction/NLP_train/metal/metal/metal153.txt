
Why is this happening to me? Why have 
I been forsaken? Nothing numbs the pain
any longer......please....I'm slipping away

We fall into the spaces blind, the puzzle so unkind
The lotus eaters fly
we watch the random pattern form, insidious and cold
And bloom into the unknown

Please God why can't you hear us?
Please God why aren't you listening?

We take the hand of fate in vain, and wonder why your will
Seems cruel controlled and illogical
Do words fall on deaf ears, are we just too small?
Please make us understand

Please God why can't you hear us?
Please God why aren't you listening?
Please God why must we fear you?
Please God why did you take her away?

Please God why can't you hear us?
Please God why aren't you listening?
Please God why must we fear you?
Please God why did you take her away?

Are we your children?
Are we lost?
