
Never resist the firewalker
He has been send
To educate you
Never look back at the great deep
And never dance
To that course he sings

Never resist
The life long pessimist
He is the leader and not the enemy
My heart complete put to destroy you
My darkness is obsolete
Please let me follow you

And when we meet there 
Into the heartshaped abyss
You'll scar me with your kiss
And when we meet there
Into the heartshaped abyss
You'll forgive me everything
Scared away get away

Never resist the firewalker
He has been send to lay a course on you
Never look back 
Never resist
Liar I am ready to push you

And when we meet there
Into the heartshaped abyss
You'll scar me with your kiss
And when we meet there
Into the heartshaped abyss
You'll forgive me everything
Scared away get away

Let's go away from this world
To a place where we are still beautiful
