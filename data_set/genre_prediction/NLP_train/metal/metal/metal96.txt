
Whatever hounts me from birth on
Is licking white blood again
It is sickering in my heart
While I divide yours in two

Lustmord 
I will never stop to hurt you
Lustmord
I will never stop to love you

I will never stop to hurt you
Now that I have you with me
So close together in one body
I feel so save but what about you

The soft sweet wound of normalcy
is sweating white blood again
I am fingering every inch of it
Grateful for who I am

You're my interruption
My crossroad of just one way
my object without a function
but still mine anyway

Unpredictable
When I kiss it burns
Irresistable
As a crowd of only one
I am so addicted and you are so down
You are nailed forever to my sense of lust

Lustmord
I will never stop to hurt you
Lustmord
I will never stop to love you
