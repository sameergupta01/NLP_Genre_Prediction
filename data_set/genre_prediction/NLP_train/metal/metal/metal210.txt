
Blood on a legion of nameless shores
- I beseech you!
Skill of a thousand nameless whores
- I invoke you!
Holding the light away
Twisting in my mind

Love of a legion of begging slaves
- I exalt you!
Screams of a thousand burning souls
- I unleash you!
Holding the light away
Twisting in my mind
Into the shadow's waking eyes

I invoke thee
Blackened lord
Night begins to crawl the skies

Kneel before your master
Shadow self
Taste the pain caressed by chains

Power of a legion of nameless lords
- I command you!
Locks of a thousand nameless doors
- I unlock you!

Lash of the 6 soul-taking strokes
- I will feed you!
Twisting in my mind
Into the shadow's waking eyes

"Spiritus Pervertus Nymph"
"Spiritus Pervertus Femme"
Twisting in my mind

I invoke thee
Blackened lord
Night begins to crawl the skies

Kneel before your master
Shadow self
Taste the pain caressed by chains

I know he steals, my body is haunted
Wicked voice in my spirit has control
Blinded by the beauty of my darkness
Makes me fly
Takes me higher

I invoke thee
Blackened lord
Night begins to crawl the skies

Kneel before your master
Shadow self
Taste the pain caressed by chains
