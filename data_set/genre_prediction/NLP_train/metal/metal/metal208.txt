
Blood on my fingers
Night in my soul
Your breath I will hear no more
I'm slowly growing cold

Your eyes are open
Dead to the light
I hear my soul cry
On the wings of death I ride

Reality seizes me
I fear I see
The truth
All my visions are fading away
Without a soul
I march to my end
Endless suffering... I fall

This is farewell and never more
Heaven nor Hell - just closing doors

Hunting the shadows
Knowing they are gone
Whispering voices
They stalk me through the dark

My eyes are open
Black, all is black
I am desperately cold
And upon my knees I crawl

Lost forever
Filled with pain
All my visions have faded away
Without a soul
I march to my end
Endless suffering I fall

This is farewell and never more
Heaven nor Hell - just closing doors

Into the grey
I'll pass without a trace
The nothingness awaits
And never more...
Fade away

This is farewell and never more
Heaven nor Hell - just closing doors
See you in Hell
