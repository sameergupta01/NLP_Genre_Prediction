
it's the lone competitor
corporate predator
deprogramming minds
of the weak, deaf and blind
whose user?
you is a consumer
slave to the advertising
it's time to realize that
we have the power to shot you down
but for now
put a no go on your logo
steady feeding your
press release media
who's a puppet?
tell'em stuff it

recognize they commercialize
homogenize your life!
marginalize and capitalizing
building up my spite

corporation, manipulation - your intention
my frustration
mass production, distribution
vile pollution, no solution

hyper consumer
afflicted with name brand tumors
aw shoot
keep me out of that unfocused group
not trying to have it
not your demographic
no concidience
power influence
fake funds false grants
buy me no chance
non profit
non issue
watch it - they tap you
what's worse
coerce
seduce
for loot no fooling y'all
her's the scoop

recognize they commercialize
homogenize your life!
marginalize and capitalizing
building up my spite

corporation, manipulation - your intention
my frustration
mass production, distribution
vile pollution, no solution

recognize they commercialize
homogenize your life!
marginalize and capitalizing
building up my spite

corporation, manipulation - your intention
my frustration
mass production, distribution
vibe pollution, no solution
