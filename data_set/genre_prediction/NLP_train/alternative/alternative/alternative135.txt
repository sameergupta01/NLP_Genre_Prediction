
Mother Tongue speaks to Me
In the strongest way I've ever seen
I know that she sees in Me
Her proudest child, her purest breed

She speaks to Me in colours
That I can't really understand
I only know that they are ours
And to those I'll proudly bend

For I am your only child
And you my dearest mystery
From an ancient throne I defy the world
To kneel before the Power within.

For I am your only child
And you my dearest mystery
World can't you see it?
Am I alone in my belief?

Virando costas ao Mundo
Orgulhosamente sós
Glória Antiga, volta a nós!

ALMA MATER!

Breaking waves announce my Bride
It is the only way the Sea could sing
Legends of Lusitanian pride
He sings the words I cannot spring

At the Moon Mountain six wolves cry
Your lost glory we'll regain or die

For I am her only child
And she is my dearest mystery
Pagan Gods in conspiracy
For the sword of Tyranny

Mother Tongue has spoke to thee
In the strongest way they've ever seen
World can't you see ?
I am not alone in my belief.

Virando costas ao Mundo
Orgulhosamente sós
Glória Antiga, volta a nós!

ALMA MATER!
