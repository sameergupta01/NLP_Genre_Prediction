Bio-Vital


When you die, your life flashes
When life turns into death, it's explosive
When love becomes hate
When things turn into opposite
There are sparks of life
Magical and electrifying

Everyone senses something
Some energy
Some spirit
Some sort of illumination
But I see it
I see it
I've seen bodies
Shining like stars
I've seen the light in your eyes
