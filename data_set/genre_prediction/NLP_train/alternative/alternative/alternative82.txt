
Motives changing
Day to day
The fire increases
Mass decay
I look at the river
White foam floats down
The bodies poisoned
Got to sit tight

The wait!

After awakening
The silence grows
Screams subside
Distortion shows
Mutant thoughts
Of bad mouthed news
It's just another birth
Of distorted views

The wait!
