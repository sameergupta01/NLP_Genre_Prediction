
Ladysmith wants you forthwith to come to her relief 
Burn your briefs you leave for France tonight
Carefully cut the straps of the booby-traps and set the captives free
But don't shoot 'til you see her big blue eyes 

Then sound the charge—breath your final breath
And charge into the valley of death
Cannon to the left and cannon to the right
They'll go bang bang bang all night 

We'll fight them on the beaches
Yes, we'll fill 'em full of lead
Fighting naked in the open air
We'll fight them in the kitchen, in the bathroom in the garden shed
Fighting the good fight any-fighting-where 

So sound the charge—breathe your final breath
And charge into the valley of death
Cannon to the left and cannon to the right
They'll go bang bang bang all night
There'll be a cannon to the left and cannon to the right
They'll go bang bang bang bang bang bang bang all night... 

"Baby baby, I love the way you talk sense to me
Especially when you say 'Neil, you got love'
I hear what you're saying...
I have in my hand a piece of paper that says
"Let's make lurrve, not this phoney war-thang"
We goin' over the top -
But you're so sexy when you're angry, honey-chile" 

"Roamin' around in no man's land, gettin' caught in your barbed wire
Baby baby, gonna set your village on fire..." 

CHARGE—I'm gonna hit you where it hurts
CHARGE—So sound the red alert!
There'll be a cannon to the left...
...And a cannon to the right...
(The hills are alive with the sound of)
BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG
BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG
BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG
All night!
