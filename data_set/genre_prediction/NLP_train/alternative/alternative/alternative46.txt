

Listen to the night
Take delight in this tune
A symphony of cries
Howling at the moon

Illuminate the wide
Hugeness of my heart
The corridor inside
I surely have to walk

Deliver me tonight
And please don't ever let me go
Heaven has arrived
But don't let anybody know
You're water to my seeds
I think I felt something alive
Answer to my needs
And heaven knows it will be right
