Don't leave me, don't go away
Stay beside me for another day
My love for you will never die

Don't leave me, don't go away
Stay near me for one more day
You know my love will never die

I would rather be
In your arms tonight
Finally to close my eyes
And you to hold me tight

I will drown again
In your arms tonight
Finally to close my eyes
Forever in your arms
