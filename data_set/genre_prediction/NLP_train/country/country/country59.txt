Could be holding you tonight
Could quit doing wrong,start right
You don't care about what I think
I think I'll just stay here and drink

Hey, putting you down won't square the deal
A least you'll know the way I feel
Hey, take all the money in the bank
I think I'll just stay here and drink

Hey, listen close so you can hear
That loud jukebox playing in my ear
Ain't no woman gonna change the way I think
I think I'll just stay here and drink

Hey, hurtin' me know don't mean a thing
Since love ain't here I don't feel a thing
My mind ain't nothing but a total blank
I think I'll just stay here and drink
