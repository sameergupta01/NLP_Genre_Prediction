I used to play around with hearts
that hastened at my call,
But when I met that little girl
I knew that I would fall.

Poor little fool, oh yeah,
I was a fool, uh huh..

She played around and teased me
with her carefree devil eyes,
She'd hold me close and kiss me
but her heart was full of lies.

Poor little fool, oh yeah,
I was a fool, uh huh..

She told me how she cared for me
and that we'd never part,
And so for the very first time
I gave away my heart.

Poor little fool, oh yeah,
I was a fool, uh huh..

The next day she was gone
and I knew she'd lied to me,
She left me with a broken heart
and won her victory.

Poor little fool, oh yeah,
I was a fool, uh huh..

I'd played this game with other hearts
but I never thought I'd see,
The day that someone else would play
love's foolish game with me.

Poor little fool, oh yeah,
I was a fool, uh huh..
