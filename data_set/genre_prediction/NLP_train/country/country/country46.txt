Duke ellington / bob russell

Some-one told some-one and some-one told you
But they wouldn't hurt you, not much,
Since ev'ryone spread the story
With his own little personal touch.

Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream is over my head.
Do nothin' till you hear from me


At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue?
When we're apart the words in my heart reveal how I feel about you.
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will.
