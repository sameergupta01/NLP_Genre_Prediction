Where was you when the train left town?
I's standin' on the corner with my head hung down.
Hey, the train carried my girl from town,
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
SPOKEN: That's kinda the way she sounded when she's rollin' away from the depot...

If I had a gun I'd let the hammer down,
Lord, I'd shoot that rounder took my girl from town.
Hey, that train that carried my girl from town,
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

There goes the train that carried my girl from town;
If I knowed her number, Lord, I'd flag her down.
Hey, the train carried my girl from town,
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Rations on the table and the coffee's gettin' cold,
And some dirty rounder stole my jelly roll.
Hey, the train carried my girl from town,
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Hello, Central, give me six-o-nine,
I want to talk to that woman of mine.
Hey, that train that carried my girl from town,
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

I wish to the Lord that the train would wreck,
Kill that engineer and break the fireman's neck.
Hey, that train done carried my girl from town,
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

SPOKEN: Rollin' on down the line...

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust,
Show me the woman that a man can trust.
Hey, that train that carried my girl from town,
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

There goes my girl, somebody bring her back,
'Cause she's got her hand in my money sack.
Hey, that train carried my girl from town,
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

SPOKEN: This is kinda way that train went when she went outa hearin'...
