Spit on the ground, hold your breath
try to scare to scare yourself to death
bury your bones under the dirt
tear your drawers and rip your shirt
stomp your feet in disgust
curse the grey skies if you must
but you'll find when you are done
the blue sky's for everyone

Take up the wine and break your heart
give up the race before you start
drop your drawers and roll around
burn your house right to the ground
go to sleep hit your head
scream until your face is red
but you'll find when you are done
the blue sky's for everyone

blue skies, setting sun
cherry pie, bubble gum
lullabies to be sung
blue skies for everyone

so get right down on your luck
spin your wheels until you're stuck
bring out the blood and let it dry
stick a big needle in your eye
dry your tears and drop your drink
let me tell you what I think
I think you'll find when you are done
the blue sky's for everyone

blue skies, setting sun
cherry pie,bubble gum
lullabies to be sung
blue skies for everyone

there'll be blue skies for everyone
there'll be blue skies for everyone
there'll be blue skies for everyone
I'd like blue skies
I'd like blue skies
I'd like blue skies for everyone
there'll be blue skies for everyone
there'll be blue skies
there'll be blue skies
