

(Rio Bravo, humming)
By the river
Rio Bravo
I walk all alone
And I wonder as I wander by the river
Where my love has flown

All the birds in the cottonwood  above her
Know I love her
Know I care
But my dreams, like the songs, she sang in Spanish
Seem to vanish
In the air
I wonder where

So I wonder as I wander
Will love come along
Must I live ever after
By the memory of her song

While the river Rio Bravo flows along
(Rio Bravo, Rio Bravo)
While the river Rio Bravo flows along
(Rio Bravo)
