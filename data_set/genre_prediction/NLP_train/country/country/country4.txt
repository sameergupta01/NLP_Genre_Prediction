You’ve been hurt
And you’ve been down
You’ve been set out of your course boy
And pushed around
Flying high, but oh you felt so low
When she walked out of that door and left you on your own

Don’t reach out for me with an apology
I’ll never suffer your desire
Don’t reach out for me with an apology
But I’ll share it

So why don’t you take my hand
Come away, come out of your blues
Boy everything you give, so will I give something to you
I’ll take you down, deep down where the love lives
Where love lives, where love lives
Follow me down, deep down where the love lives
Where love lives, where love lives
Just come on in

(We’re gonna have a good time, are you with me? - Yeah!)

Come on in, come on in, come on in
Come on in, come on in, come on in, eh-eh-eh-eh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

So you’re longing for the warmth of somebody
You’ve got nothing in this world to lose
Let me take you down where love lives
Come away, come on out of your blues

Don’t reach out for me with an apology
I’ll never suffer your desire
Don’t reach out for me with an apology
But I’ll share it

So why don’t you take my hand
Come away, come out of your blues
Boy everything you give, so will I give something to you
I’ll take you down, deep down where the love lives
Where love lives, where love lives
Follow me down, deep down where the love lives
Where love lives, where love lives
Just come on in, where love lives
Just come on in….

Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh where love lives
Where love lives, where love lives
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh where love lives
Where love lives, where love lives

Just come on in, where love lives…
