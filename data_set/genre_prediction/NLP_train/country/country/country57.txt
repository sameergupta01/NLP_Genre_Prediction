When we dance together my world's in disguise it's a fairyland tale that come true
And when you look at me with those stars in your eyes
I could waltz across Texas with you
Waltz across Texas with you in my arms waltz across Texas with you
Like a storybook ending I'm lost in your charms
And I could waltz across Texas with you
[ steel - ac.guitar ]
My heartaches and troubles are just up and gone the moment that you come in view
And with your hand in mine dear I could dance on and on
And I could waltz across Texas with you
Waltz across Texas...
