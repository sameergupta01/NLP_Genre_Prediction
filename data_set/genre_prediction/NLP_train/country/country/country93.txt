
Jesse come home
There's a hole in the bed
Where we slept
Now it's growing cold
Hey Jesse, your face
In the place where we lay
By the hearth, all apart
It hangs on my heart

And I'm leaving the light on the stairs
No I'm not scared - I wait for you
Hey Jesse, I'm lonely, come home

Jesse, the floors and the boards
Recalling your step
And I remember, too
All the pictures are fading
And shaded in grey
But I still set a place
On the table at noon

And I'm leaving a light on the stairs
No I'm not scared - I wait for you
Hey Jesse, I'm lonely, come home

Jesse, the spread on the bed
Is like when you left
I've kept it up for you
And all the blues and the greens
Have been recently cleaned
And it's seemingly new
Hey Jes, me and you

We'll swallow the light on the stairs
We'll do up my hair
And sleep unaware
Hey Jesse, I'm lonely, come home
