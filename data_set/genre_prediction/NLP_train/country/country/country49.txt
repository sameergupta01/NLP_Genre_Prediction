There's an Old Christmas Card in an old dusty trunk
And it brings back sweet mem'ries dear to me
'Tho it's faded and worn, it's as precious as the morn
When I found it 'neath our first Christmas tree

Chorus:
I thrill with every word, every line
Guess I'm always sentimental 'round this time
Pardon me if a tear falls among my Christmas cheer
It's the mem'ry of an Old Christmas Card

SPOKEN:
You know, I don't know why I get to feeling sentimental about this
time, every year. But every time I see a Christmas card, I somehow
can't help reminiscing. About the very first Christmas that you and
I spent together. What a beautiful Christmas card you gave me that
year. Why, I know you must have looked through thousands of cards
to find that wonderful poem that still brings a tear to my eyes

REPEAT CHRUS
