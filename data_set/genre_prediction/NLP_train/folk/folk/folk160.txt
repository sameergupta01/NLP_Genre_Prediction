
The little man walked up and down
To find an eating place in town
He read the menu through and through
To see what 15 cents could do

One meat ball
One meat ball
He could afford but one meat ball

He told the waiter near at hand
The simple dinner he had planned
The guests were startled one and all
To hear the waiter loudly call

One meat ball Everbody
One meat ball
Hey this here gent wants one meat ball

You know, the liitle man fet ill at ease
He said some bread sir If you please
The waiter hollered down the hall
You gets no bread with one meat ball

One meat ball
One meat ball
Well, you gets no bread with one meat ball

The little man felt very bad
One meat ball was all he had
And in his dreams he hears that call
You gets no bread with one meat ball

One meat ball and no spaghetti
One meat ball
You gets no bread with one meat ball

Let's try it one more time, Now

One meat ball
One meat ball
That one was gooey
You gets no bread with one meat ball
