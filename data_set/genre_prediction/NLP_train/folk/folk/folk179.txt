
We said we'd walk together, come what may
If in the twilight should we lose our way
If as we're walking a hand should slip free
I'll wait for you, if I should fall behind, wait for me

We swore we'd travel, side by side
We'd help each other stay in stride
But each lover's steps fall so differently
I'll wait for you, if I should fall behind, wait for me

Everyone dreams of love lasting and true
Oh, but you and I know what this world can do
So let's make our steps clear that the other may see
I'll wait for you, if I should fall behind, wait for me

Now there's a beautiful river in the valley ahead
There 'neath the oak's bough where we soon will be wed
But if we lose each other in the shadow of the evening trees
I'll wait for you, if I should fall behind, wait for me

Darling, I'll wait for you, if I should fall behind, wait for me
Oh, I'll wait for you, if I should fall behind, wait for me
