
Of a' the airts the wind can blaw
 I dearly love the west
 For there the bonnie lassie lives 
 The lass i love the best
 There wild woods grow and rivers row
 And many a hill between
 Both day and night my fancy's flight
 Is ever with my Jean

 Blaw you westlin winds, blaw saft 
 Amang the leafy trees
 I hear her voice in ilka bird
 Bring hame the laden bees
 And bring the lassie back to me 
 The mountain, shaw or green
 Ae blink o' her wad banish care
 Sae lovely is my Jean 

 What sighs and vows amang yon knows 
 Hae past atween us twa
 Sae fain tae meet, I wae tae pairt 
 The day she gang awa
 The powers above can only know 
 To whom my heart has seen
 Bring the lassie back to me
 Nane can be sae dear to me
 My sweet and lovely Jean
