Take my hand
Break my stride
Make me smile
For everytime i've cried
Hold my heart
In the palm of your hands
Don't listen to it breakin'
Just listen to the band

You wanna ride in my car
It's parked out on the street
Or just stay with me awhile
Before I fall asleep

Take these tears
Wash your skin
I'm having trouble breathing
Since you walked in

My hands are tied
My head is reelin'
My eyes have cried a million tears
From wishing you were here

All my life
I've welcomed pain
I've made up more excuses
To bring it back again
Now i'm here
And i'll drink to the shame
I'll drink to the madness
That made me this way

My hands are tied
My head is reelin'
My eyes have cried a million tears
From wishing you were here

Take these tears
Wash your skin
I'm having trouble breathing
Since you walked in
