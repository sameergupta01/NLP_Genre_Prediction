everybody loves you
and they want to know your story
you go riding out a mystery
concealed in all your glory
but when it comes to flesh and bones
you remind me of shallot
only made of shadows
even though you're not

i remember how i spent
all my energy and time
with affected conversation
trying to pry inside your mind
you are as beautiful as truth
and as empty as a shell
and i came to you one night
and it made me feel like hell

oh to reach through all your surface
just to find an empty pool
and to suffer all your pride
as i lay down by your side
and you swallowed up my heart
and left me a fool
left me a fool

everybody loves a hero
an image to create
the antithesis of everything
inside ourselves we hate
but you'd better close your eyes
when it's time for them to die
because you'd hate to think the life
you'd built upon them was a lie

oh to reach through all your surface
just to find an empty pool
and to suffer all your pride
as i lay down by your side
and you swallowed up my heart
and left me a fool
left me a fool

i resign myself to silence
i will never blow your cover
no one ever has to know
who the hero took for lover
but it comes to mind as you blaze on
as brilliant as a star
how many you've left behind
how many casualties there are

oh to reach through all your surface
just to find an empty pool
and to suffer all your pride
as i lay down by your side
and you swallowed up my heart
and left me a fool
left me a fool
