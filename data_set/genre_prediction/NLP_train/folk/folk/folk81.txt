When the world ends
Collect your things
You're coming with me
When the world ends
You tuckle up yourself with me
Watch it as the stars disappear to nothing
The day the world is over
We'll be lying in bed

I'ma rock you like a baby when the cities fall
We'll rise as the buildings crumble
Float there and watch it all
Amidst the burning, we'll be churning
You know, love will be our wings
The passion rises up from the ashes
When the world ends

When the world ends
You're gonna come with me
We're going to be crazy
Like a river bends
We're going to float
Through the criss cross of the mountains
Watch them fade to nothing
When the world ends
You know that's what's happening now
I'm going to be there with you somehow, oh...

I'ma tie you up like a baby in a carriage car
Your legs don't work cause you want me so
You just lie spread to the wall
The love you got is surely
All the love that I would ever need
I'ma to take you by my side
And love you tall, 'til the world ends

Oh, but don't you worry about a thing
No, 'cause I got you here with me
Don't you worry about it
Just you and me
Floating through the empty, empty
Just you and me
Oh, graces
Oh, grace

Oh, when the world ends
We'll be burning one
When the world ends
We'll be sweet makin love
Oh, you know when the world ends
I'm going to take you aside and say
Let's watch it fade away, fade away
And the world's done
Ours just begun
It's done
Ours just begun

We're gonna dive into the emptiness
We'll be swimming
I'm going to walk you through the pathless roads
I'm going to take you to the top of the mountain that's no longer there
I'm going to take you to bed and love you, I swear
Like the end is near

I'm going to take you up to
I'm going to take you down on you
I'm going to hold you like an angel, angel

I'ma to love you
I'ma to love you
When the world ends
I'ma to hold you
When the world is over
We'll just begin...
