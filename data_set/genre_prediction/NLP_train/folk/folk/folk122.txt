There's flies buzzing 'round me, I'm begging for a breeze

The grass that surrounds me is so high that I can't see

There's something out there watching me and I can't find no peace

If it catches up with me, its gonna kill me by degrees

Stand up, Wake up

The sun is sinking fast now and the night is moving in

I've got to find a place where I know I won't be seen

If you're out there can't you help me, 'cause I try but I can't scream

And I know that its not real, but I can't break out of this dream

Stand up, Wake up

This song is for the people living this dream

Their minds twisted in an endless scream

We're walking through a graveyard, the wind howling through the trees

We've got to wake up soon or life will pass by like a breeze

What's it gonna take to make you realize
You're killing yourself I've seen it in your eyes

Stand up, Wake up
