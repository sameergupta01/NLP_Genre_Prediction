There must be some kind of way out of here
Said the joker to the thief
Too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Business men, they drink my wine
Plow men dig my Earth
None of them will own the line
Nor any of it's worth
No reason to get excited
The thief he kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I we've been through all that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late
All along the watchtower
Princes kept their view
while all the women, all the women, all the women, came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside in the cold distance
A wild cat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

The money safe
The thief he take
The money safe
The thief he take

No reason to get excited
