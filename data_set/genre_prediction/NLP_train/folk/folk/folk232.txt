
I just can't keep going along
Making believe nothing's wrong
It's wrong and it's always gonna be
Nothing you did in any way
Nothing you said or didn't say
It's not you, baby it's me

So keep on being long and tall
Keep on talkin with the same ol' drawl
Keep on baby don't you trip and fall over me

The petals of the daisy drop
You love me then, you love me not
You love me not, it's plain to see
Who keeps the fire burning bright
The one who's losing sleep at night
It ain't you, baby it's me

So keep the rose you never brought
Keep that ring that you never bought
It's all my fault, it's all my fantasy

Oh, but I can't give you no more of myself
'Cuz I'm lookin out for somebody else
It ain't you, baby it's me

Oh, but I can't give you no more of myself
'Cuz I'm lookin' out for somebody else
It ain't you, baby it's me
