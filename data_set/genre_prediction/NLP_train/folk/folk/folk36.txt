(Lardie, Niven)

I see you bleed the feelings you close up
I know the pain that you hide
Oh baby please don't be no close out
Stay with me through the night

Needle Street ain't no answer
Can't dream a heartache away
Let the need be your master
All of your dreams fade away

Everything you want
Everything you want

Anything you want
Anything you want
You can find it right here

Ah no don't go
Down to the midnight motel
Oh no so low
Can't find no heaven in hell

There's a silence that comes in the morning
Leaves you screamin' at the wall
As you sit there in your easy chair
Chasin' demons at a crawl

When you feel that you'll never find
Somewhere y'll be safe to lie
Just take a look over here
Together we'll rise in a mornin' glory

Anything you want
Anything you want

Everything you want
Everything you want
You can find it right here

Don't go don't go
Down to the Old Rose Motel

Oh no don't go
Down to the midnight hotel
