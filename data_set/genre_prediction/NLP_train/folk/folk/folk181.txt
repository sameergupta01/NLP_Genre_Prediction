And who are you me pretty fair maid
And who are you me honey
She answered me quite modestly
I am me mother's darling
With me too-ry-ay Fol de diddle day
Di-re, Fol de did-dle dair-ie o

And will you come to me mother's house
When the sun is shining clearly
When the sun is shining clearly
I'll open the door and I'll let you in
And divil a one would hear us

So I went to her house in the middle of the night
When the moon was shining clearly
When the moon was shining clearly
She opened the door and let me in
And divil the one did hear us.

She took me horse by the bridle and the bit
And she led him to the stable
And she led him to the stable
Saying, There's plenty of oats for a soldier's horse
To eat if he's able

Then she took me by the lily-white hand
And she led me to the table
And she led me to the table
Saying, There's plenty of wine for a soldier boy
To drink if you're able

Then I got up and made the bed
And I made it nice and aisy
And I made it nice and aisy
Then I got up and laid her down
Saying, "Lassie are you able?"

And there we lay till the break of day
And divil a one did hear us
And divil a one did hear us
Then I arose and put on me clothes
Saying, "Lassie, I must leave you"

And when will you return again
And when will we get married
And when will we get married
When broken shells make Christmas bells
We might well get married
