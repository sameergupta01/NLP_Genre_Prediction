Everywhere I go
I see a face we used to know
I pass a place we used to go
when you were mine

since you went away
my heart's not free
it keeps raining down on me
will there be a day
when the sun will shine

I wanna see the sunshine after the rain
I wanna see bluebirds flying
over the mountains again (sunshine after the rain)
oh where is the silver lining
shining at the rainbow's end

when I hear your name
I start to cry,
each day is the same since your goodbye
it's like a game, forgetting you

every night I pray
tomorrow brings a sunny day and happy things
just like the way it used to be for you and me

I wanna to see the sunshine after the rain
I wanna to see bluebirds flying
over the mountains again
sunshine after the rain

oh where is the silver lining
shining at the rainbow's end

everywhere I go
I see a face we used to know
I pass a place we used to go
when you were mine

since you went away (since you went away)
my heart's not free
it keeps raining down on me
will there be a day when the sun will shine

I wanna see the sunshine after the rain
I wanna see bluebirds flying
over the mountains again (sunshine after the rain)
oh where is the silver lining
shining at the rainbow's end

I wanna see the sunshine after the rain
I wanna see bluebirds flying over the mountains again
sunshine after the rain
oh where is the silver lining shining at the rainbow's end
