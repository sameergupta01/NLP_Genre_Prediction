hey honey what you trying to say
as i stand here
don't you walk away
and the world comes tumbling down
hand in hand in a violent life
making love on the edge of a knife
and the world comes tumbling down
and it's hard
for me to say
and it's hard
for me to stay
i'm going down
to be by myself
i'm going back
for the good of my health
and there's one thing
i couldnt do
sacrifice myself to you
sacrifice
baby baby i just can't see
just what you mean to me
i take my aim and i fake my words
i'm just your long time curse
and if you walk away
i can't take it
but that's the way that you are
and that's the things that you say
but now you've gone too far
with all the things you say
get back to where you come from
i can't help it
under the april skies
under the april sun
sun grows cold
sky gets black
and you broke me up
and now you won't come back
shaking hand, life is dead
and a broken heart
and a screaming head
under the april sky
