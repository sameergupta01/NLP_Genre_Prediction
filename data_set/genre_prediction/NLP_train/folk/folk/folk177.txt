Come, all you lads and lassies, and listen to me a while
I'll sing to you a verse or two that will surely make you smile
Concerning a young man I'm going to tell you now
Who has lately came a-courtin' the maid of the sweet brown knowe

This young man says, "My pretty maid, will you come along with me?
We'll both fly off together, and happy we will be
We'll join our hands in wedlock bands as I'm speaking with you now
And I'll do my best endeavor for the maid of the sweet brown knowe"

This fair and fickle young thing, she knew not what to say
Her eyes did shine like diamonds bright and merrily did play
She says, "Young man, your love's subdued, for I'm not ready now
And I'll spend another season at the foot of the sweet brown knowe

The young man said: "My pretty maid, how can you answer so?
See down in yonder valley where my crops do gently grow
Down in yonder valley I have horses, men and plow
And they`re at the daily labor for the maid of the sweet brown knowe"

"If they're at their daily labor, kind sir, 't is not for me
I've heard of your behavior, I have indeed," said she
"There is an inn where you call in, I've heard the people say
And you rap and you call and you pay for all and go home at the break of day

"If I rap and I call and I pay for all, the money it is my own
And I'll never spend your fortune, for I hear that you got none
You thought you had my poor heart won, by meeting with me now
But I'll leave you where I found you: At the foot of the sweet brown knowe"
