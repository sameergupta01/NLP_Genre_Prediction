You know my best friend,
Just left yesterday and I know
I know your girlfriend,
Wasn't here to stay, she just moved away
Things are so the same,
That all I can really bring
Myself to say is that I know


And remember when they said
Just how long can you ideals
Keep you warm and we just
Laughed that kinda nervous laugh
And we just sang along to that song on the radio
To that song that's on the radio


And yeah just outside,
The conversations getting old.
And I know they're right,
Betting smokes that our end is just as close.
Things are so the same.


You were right about,
Just how we'd figure out
Things change but beliefs stay the same
And you were right about just how we'd figure out
A change of ideas I've known.
