You'll find me in a Barlin bar
In a corner, brooding
You know that I go very quiet
When I am listening to you
There's something special indeed
In all the places where I've seen you shine, boy
There's something very real in how I feel, honey

It's in me, it's in me - and you know it's for real
Turning in your saxophone
Doo - ba - doo - ba - doo

The candle burning over your shoulder
Is throwing shadowson your saxophone
A surly lady in tremor
The stars that climb from her bowels'
Those stars make towers on vowels
You'll never know that you had all of me
You'll never see the poetry you stirred in me
Of all the stars I've seen that shine so brightly
I've never known or felt, in myself, so rightly

It's in me, it's in me - and you know it's real
Turning in your saxophone
Doo - ba - doo - ba - doo
