I took my love
And I took it down
I climbed a mountain
And I turned around
And I saw my reflection
in a snow covered hill
Well the Landslide brought me down

Oh mirror in the sky what is love
Can a child within my heart rise above
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides
Can I handle the seasons of my life

Uh ah ... uh ah .... uh ah ...
uh ah ... uh ah ....uh ah....

Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I built my life around you
But time makes bolder
Children get older
I'm getting older too
Well...

(Instrumental)

Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I build my life around you
But time makes bolder
Well Children get older
I'm getting older too

Well, I'm getting older too

So, take this love and take it down
Yeah, and if you climb a Mountain and ya turn around
And If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well the landslide brought me down

And If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills

Well maybe... Well maybe... Well maybe

Landslide will bring you down.
