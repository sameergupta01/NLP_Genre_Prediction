Sometimes you walk like an angel
Sometimes you walk like a man
Sometimes you crawl like a baby
Makes me forget who I am.
Have you ever been held before
like honey to the bee?
I've never been held before
Like you hold me.

Chorus-
You make me feel like a river
Like a water overflow
Wanna shout it out from the mountain
wanna sing it on the radio
I'd sell my soul like a sinner
If it means you"ll never go

I think the sun is finally rising
It's burning down because I miss you
I'm gonna walk right through the fires
Cos all I wanna do is kiss you
Oh rainfalls won't wash this away
I'll build a stone wall
To make you stay

Chorus-
You make me feel like a river
like a water overflow
Wanna shout it out from the mountain
wanna sing it on the radio
I'd sell my soul like a sinner
If it means you'll never go.

Ooohhhh You make me feel like a river
Like a water overflow
Wanna shout it out from the mountain
Wanna sing it on the radio
I'd sell my soul like a sinner
if it means you'll never go
Never go
Never go.
