
Oh who would have
Ever known this?
Could be this easy
I was a long, long way off
Then just like that it was over
Everything I knew of love
I was a long, long way off

And I think I like
How the day sounds
Like how the day sounds
Through this new song

Thank you for opening the window
The sky is clear as my mind is now
I was a long, long way off
Join me in welcoming the sun in
It's much brighter
Than the night I hid in
I was a long, long way off

And I think I like how
The day sounds
Like how the day sounds
Through this new song
And I think I like how
The day sounds
Like how the day sounds
Through this new song

From a long way down

Yeah, it's well worth the time
That it's taken to get here now
Yeah, it's well worth the time
That it's taken to get here now

Ba da dum

So go ahead and bang a gong
Nothing can drown
Out the sound
And the whisper of my love

And I think I like how
The day sounds
Like how the day sounds
Through this new song
And I think I like how
The day sounds
Like how the day sounds
Through this new song
Through this new song
Through this new song

And the blinds
Have all been drawn
I know where I belong
Where I belong,
Where I belong
And the blinds
Have all been drawn
I know where I belong
Where I belong

And I think I like
How the day sounds
Like how the day sounds
Through this new song
And I think I like how
The day sounds
Like how the day sounds
Through this new song

Oh, won't you sing along
Oh, my love
Won't you sing along
Oh, won't you sing along
Oh, my love
Won't you sing along
Oh, won't you sing along
Oh, my love
Won't you sing along
Oh, won't you sing along
Oh, my love
Won't you sing along
