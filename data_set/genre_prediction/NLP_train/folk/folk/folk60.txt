sometimes in our lives
we all have pain,
we all have sorrow
But if we are wise
we know that there's
always tomorrow

CHORUS
lean on me
when you're not strong
I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on,
For it won't be long
till I'm gonna need somebody to lean on

Please swallow your pride
if i have things
you need to borrow
For no one can fill those of your needs
that you won't let show

Just call on me brother
when you need a hand
we all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem
that you'd understand
we all need somebody to lean on

CHORUS

Just call on me brother
when you need a hand
we all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem
that you'd understand
we all need somebody to lean on

If there is a load
you have to bear
that you can't carry
I'm right up the road
i'll share your load
if you'll just call me

Call me...when you need a friend
call me...call me..
and i'll be your friend...
call me...call me
Repeat 2x
