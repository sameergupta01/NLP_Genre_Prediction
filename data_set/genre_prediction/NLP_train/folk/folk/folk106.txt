Take my shoulder back now,
Your head's too heavy for me.
Please don't come around here no more,
Cause I asked you to stop,
You didn't

I would give anything,
to make you better.
I would give anything,
to point you to free.
And I would give anything,
to help you realise.

I loved you till it killed me,
So my logic wouldn't hurt you
I know you might blame me anyway.
Well I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry

I would give anything,
to make you better.
I would give anything,
to point you to free.
I would give anything,
to help you to realise.
You're not helping yourself
to me.

I've tried all the things
they told me to do,
Tried to close up the wound
left open by you,
and if I seemed ever distrusting i am
You said you wouldn't do it again,
You said you wouldn't do it again.

I would give anything,
to make you better.
I would give anything,
to point you to free.
And I would do anything,
to help you realise.
You're not helping yourself,
You're not helping yourself by hurting me.
