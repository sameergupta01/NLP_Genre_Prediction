
Oh wind, won't you sweep me up into the sky
So I can get a better look at this life of mine
And pick me up and twist me around
So I can see everything around me now

Oh, won't you embrace me?
Oh, won't you embrace me?
Oh, won't you embrace me, me?
Oh, won't you embrace me?

Oh river, won't you take me out into the sea
So I can get a good look back at the land that grounds me
And then a bit more further out
So I can feel alone much more than I have these days

Oh, then won't you embrace me?
Oh, won't you embrace me?
Oh, won't you embrace me?
Won't you embrace me?

I figure there's time later on to move along
From this there is time enough of it for right or wrong
I figure there's time so go easy on me
And let me stay here a while, stay here awhile

Oh wind, won't you take me up to the sky
I can get a good look down at this life of mine
River, won't you take me out into the sea
I can get a good look back at the land that grounds me
The land that grounds me, land that grounds me, me
Land that grounds me, me
