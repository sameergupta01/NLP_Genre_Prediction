
As I was a walking one morning last autumn
I've overheard some nobles foxhunting
Between some noblemen and the Duke of Wellington
So early before the day was dawning.

Chorus (after each verse):
There was Dido, Bendigo, Gentry he was there-o
Traveler, he never looked behind him.
There was Countess, Rover, Bonnie Lass and Jover
These were the hounds that could find him.
Well the first fox being young,
And his trials just beginning
He's made straight way for his cover
He's run up yon highest hill
And gone down yon lowest gill
Thinking that he'd find his freedom there forever.

Well the next fox being old,
And his trials fast advancing
He's made straight way for the river
Well the fox he has jumped in
But an hound jumped after him
It was Traveler who straited him forever.

Well they run across the plain
But they soon returned again
The fox nor the hounds never failing
It's been just twelve months today,
Since I heard the squire say,
Hark, forward then me brave hounds forever.
