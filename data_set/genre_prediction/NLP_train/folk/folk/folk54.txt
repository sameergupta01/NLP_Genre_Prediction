A soldier is obsessed with his love - a
true charmer.

For the charmer courted me,
And she stole away my love,
When my heart was young and fair,
She was the maid beyond compare.

When my head was hanging low
Well, she fought through frost and snow.
In my arms she'll rest away
For the charmer I would name.

Tell it to the charmer, so fine and pretty.
Farewell charmer.

She brought that summer fright,
We were separate every night.
On those winter days to prove
She’s away on the morning dew.

I wish but it`s in vain,
For the soldier I became,
Fighting lands I'd never see,
For the grass will cover me.

Tell it to the charmer, so fine and pretty.
Farewell charmer.

Well her bed is fine as silk,
The sheets as white as milk.
When my heart has gone away.
I`ll leave a bed as cold as clay.

She has two hearts I have none.
All alone when I am done.
To that charmer I endure,
For the price of love and war.

So tell it to the charmer, she’s so fine
and pretty.
Farewell charmer
