Rollin' down highway 95
Sailin' through her hometown countryside
Move on over stand astride
My cruise control's in overdrive
Need to take my baby for a ride

Ooo she's like a smooth stretch of highway
Ooo she's like a cool Summer breeze
If my motor's runnin' right, we might lose control tonight
Got the shape I love to squeeze, looks that bring me to my knees
Oh please, let it roll tonight

Might be doin' more thahn fifty-five
When I sit my baby right down by my side
Where the rubber hit the road
This rig don't dig no overload
Come on, and let my baby ride

Ooo she's like a smooth stretch of highway
Ooo she's like a cool Summer breeze
If my motor's runnin' right, we might lose control tonight
Got the shape I love to squeeze, looks that bring me to my knees
Oh please, let it roll tonight

Now I know just how heaven feels
When she reach beneath my big old steerin' wheel
Dyna flow, power glide
Bored and stroked, I'm satisfied
When I take my baby for a ride

Ooo she's like a smooth stretch of highway
Ooo she's like a cool Summer breeze
If my motor's runnin' right, we might lose control tonight
Got the shape I love to squeeze, looks that bring me to my knees
Oh please, let it roll tonight
