Well Anne's pretty neat,
She always eats her meat,
Joe is awful strong,
Bet your life he's puttin' us on.
Oh lordy!
Oh Lordy!
You know I need some lovin'
I'm movin', touch me!
CHORUS
John, I'm only dancing,
She turns me on,
But I'm only dancing,
she turns me on.
But don't get me wrong.
I'm only dancing!

Jack is so nice and clean
Life is a well thumbed machine
I saw you watchin' from the stairs
you're everyone who ever cared.
Oh lordy!
Oh lordy!
You know I need some lovin'
I'm movin'
Touch me!
CHORUS (x2)
Dancing!
Won't someone touch me.
TOUCH ME!
WOAH!
