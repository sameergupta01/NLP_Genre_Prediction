I love your eyes when you look away
Thinking somewhere else of what ought to be
When they're suddenly blue for a moment of time
Then the colour goes when you look at me

I love your hands as a part of you
As they write a word just by staying still
When you talk they move, painting what you say
So i understand more than words can tell

I love your hair in the dark it's soft
In the light it moves, red and green are brown
All the time it takes for a night to pass
And a lifetime grows as the day comes down

I love you now as you don't love me
I can't let you know you're too far away
But i wonder now just what did you see
When you looked at me in that loveless way
