Lyrics - Miles And Miles Of Texas

I was born in lousiana down on the ol bouyo
rasied on shrimps and catfish mame's good gumbo
I got the ramblin' fever said goodby to ma and pa
crossed that ol red river and this is what I saw

I saw miles and miles of texas all the stars up in the sky
I saw miles and miles of texas gonna live here till I die

(instrumental)


I rode up in to austin the craddle of the west
just ask any cowboy he'll tell you it's the best
I met a texas bueaty I got friendly with her pa
I looked in to her big blue eyes this is what I saw

I saw miles and miles of texas all the stars up in the sky
I saw miles and miles of texas gonna live here till I die

(instrumental)


I started tamin' bronko's I made every rodeo
until I met a tuff one you know his name was devil joe
I grabb'd hold of his bridle just to ride this ol' outlaw
he threw me from the saddle and this is what I saw

I saw miles and miles of texas all the stars up in the sky
I saw miles and miles of texas gonna live here till I die

(fiddles)
(spoken)
miles of texas

(fiddles)
(spoken)
all night long
(fiddles)
(sung)
gonna live here till I die
(spoken)
aaaaaaaah, texas
