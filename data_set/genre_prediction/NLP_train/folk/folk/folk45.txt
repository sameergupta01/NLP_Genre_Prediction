Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do to you

You're in love
Your heart's a flutter and all day long
You only shutter
Cuz your poor tongue
Just won't utter the words
I love you

Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do
Wait a while
Till a little moonbeam comes peepin' through

You'll get bold
You can't resist him
And all you'll say
When you have kissed him is

Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do
