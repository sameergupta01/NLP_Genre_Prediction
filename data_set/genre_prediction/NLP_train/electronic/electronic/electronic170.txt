Chorus:
Never can say goodbye
No no no no, I
Never can say goodbye

Even though the pain and heartache
Seems to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show
Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say no...

Tell me why
Is it so

That I
Never can say goodbye
No no no no, I
Never can say goodbye

Everytime I think I've had enough
I start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
piercin me right to the core
It says turn around you fool
You know you love her more and more

Tell me why
(tell me why)
Is it so
(is it so)
Don't wanna let you go!

I can never can say goodbye girl
(never can say goodbye girl)
ou ou baby
(don't wanna let you go girl)
I never can say goodbye
no no no no no no no no no no no

ou! oh!
I never can say goodbye girl
(never can say goodbye girl)
ouuuuuuuu ouuuuuuuuuu
never can say goodbye
no no no no no no no no no no no

(chorus)


I keep thinkin that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling and there's that anguish, there's that
doubt
It's the same old did ya hang up
Can't do with you or without

Tell me why
Is it so
Don't wanna let you go

[Repeat till fade]
