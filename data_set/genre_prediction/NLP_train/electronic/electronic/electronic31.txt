

I never wanted to be, like every other child abandoned in childhood drama (oh)
I always felt that I was the exception to the rule but now who's the fool
you won't give me your love your love
so when you left me I filled up that empty place and never told it's still hollow (it's still hollow)
can't you see potential you have and what you dreamed if it's not based in reality
and your denial is a tragedy
and your excuses backed up by love can hinder more than a brave risk you take even if it cracks on this floor
you won't give me your love 
you weren't living your love
you won't give me your love
your love

so when you left me I filled up that empty place and never told it's still hollow (it's still hollow)
why is it you believe that to quit is better than really trying to succeed
I wish you'd stayed to guide me
it seems that I, I don't fit in anywhere that I can see
I can't follow your lead, oh

you won't give me your love
you weren't living your love
you won't give me your love
you weren't living your love
you won't give me your love
your love

so when you left me I filled up that empty place and never told it's still hollow 
so I walk to the shore to cry my tears in the ocean 
I can see that looking in my eyes ain't enough to bring you back no more
back no more

you won't give me your love 
you weren't living your love (repeat till fade)
