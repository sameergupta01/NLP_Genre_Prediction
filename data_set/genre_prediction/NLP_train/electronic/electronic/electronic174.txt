It was the time of the preacher when the story began.
Of the choice of a lady and the love of a man.
How he loved her so dearly, he went out of his mind.
When she left him for someone, she'd left behind.

An' he cried like a baby;
He screamed like a panther in the middle of the night.
An' he saddled his pony,
An he went for a ride.

It was the time of the preacher in the year of 01.
Now the preachin' is over and the lesson's begun.

Instrumental close.

PART TWO:

But he could not forgive her,
Though he tried and tried and tried.
And the halls of his memories,
Still echo her lies.

He cried like a baby;
He screamed like a panther in the middle of the night.
An' he saddled his pony,
An he went for a ride.

It was the time of the preacher in the year of 01.
Now the lesson is over and the killin's begun.

PART THREE:

It was the time of the preacher in the year of 01.
An' just when you think it's all over, it's only begun.
