Life can be so shady.
The way some people try to bring you down.
Why's it got to be so crazy?
Always try to give you the run around.
So I let the music just take control.
Cause it rocks my body.
And it moves my soul.
I can't stop dancing to the beat.
And I just can't help it.
I just can't help it.
Cause music is my life.
It helps me through the night.
MUSIC IS MY LIFE!
