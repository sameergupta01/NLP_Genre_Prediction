We can be together for now and forever
I love you, I love you.
Hey, can you hear me, I got to have you near me,
I love you, I love you.
I was lonely 'til you came along
Now you've got me singing your love song.

I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you.

Life is a mystery, love is a dancer,
I love you, I love you.
I had a question, you brought the answer,
I love you, I love you.
Oh, but I need you so,
I could never let you go.

I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you.

I was lonely once but then you came along,
And you gave me love so I wrote down this song.
