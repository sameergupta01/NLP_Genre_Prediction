Words by Peggy Lee
Music by Victor Young

Play the guitar,
play it again,
my Johnny,
Maybe you're cold,
but you're so warm inside.
I was always a fool for my Johnny,
For the one they call JOHNNY GUITAR.
Play it again,
JOHNNY GUITAR.
What if you go, what if you stay,
I love you,
What if you're cruel,
you can be kind, I know,
There was never a man like my Johnny,
Like the one they call JOHNNY GUITAR
