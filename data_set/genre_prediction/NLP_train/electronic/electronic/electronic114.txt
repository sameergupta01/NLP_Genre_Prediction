I ain't got no home
No place to roam
I ain't got a home
No place to roam
I'm a lonely boy
I ain't got a home

I ain't got no sister
I ain't got a brother
I ain't got a father
Not even a mother
I'm a lonely boy
I ain't got a home

Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo

Well, I got a voice
And I love to sing
I can sing like a bird
And I can sing like a frog
I'm a lonely boy
I ain't got a home

I ain't got a girl
I ain't got a son
I ain't got no kin
I ain't got no one
I'm a lonely frog
I ain't got a home

Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo

Madam, take me in
Let me be your friend
Won't you take me in
Let me be your friend
I'm a lonely boy
I ain't got a home

Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo
