See a glimpse inside the pool, it's hollow,
Come to know a time when he will haunt you.
Snapping at my heals made me live,
Someone take me back to the angel realm, today.

Each step I take the shadows grow longer,
Padded footfalls in the dark I wander.
Come to steal your lifeblood away,
Looking for a beauty that never fades.
