Hey where did we go?
The days when the rains came
Down in the hollow, playing a new game
Laughing and a running hey, hey!
Skipping and a jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our hearts a thumpin' and you
My brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl

Whatever happened to Tuesday and so slow?
Going down the old mine with a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and sliding, all along the waterfall, with you
My brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing?
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
Just like that
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
La te da

So hard to find my way, now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day, my, you have grown!
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinking about
Making love in the green grass, behind the stadium with you
My brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing?
Sha la la la la la la la la la la de da
Sha la la la la la la la la la la de da
Sha la la la la la la la la la la de da
