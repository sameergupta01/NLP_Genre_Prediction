

I'm sitting in my room
Thinking back on you,
Memories pass;
My head was leaned against your face
partly on your shoulder, curving your neck.
I tried to clear my thoughts of stress
And let go of the day,
How it began,
whispered your name-

&lt;chorus&gt;
Soft white lights between us falling
forming into precious flowers, chartreuse
beautiful and floating down on us
sparkles flying towards us dancing all around us
vanish in air

But you left before you knew
A future holding you.
All you saw of me-
My heart should speak for me,
Then you'd understand
that push away-
It craves compassion and
strong arms to hold her.

You and me
Revolving
angel wings
fluttering
Orange gold
Sunsets bold
Star filled nights
Sweet as Fantasia

And still
A glow surrounding you
The dandelions blew
Our wishes to the wind
Come and bring him back again

&lt;chorus&gt;
Soft white lights between us falling
forming into precious flowers, chartreuse
beautiful and floating down on us
sparkles flying towards us dancing all around us
vanish in air

And I wonder how you felt
-I was melting inside
Opened my eyes
-Felt so bright I was blind
The car we hadn't left
I closed the door
behind
-And I wished you would take me away.

You left before I waved.
By then it was too late.
I wished on the moon
I'd always remember-

You and me
Revolving
angel wings
fluttering
Orange gold
Sunsets bold
Star filled nights
Sweet as Fantasia

&lt;chorus&gt;
Soft white lights between us falling
forming into precious flowers, chartreuse
beautiful and floating down on us
sparkles flying towards us dancing all around us
vanish in air
