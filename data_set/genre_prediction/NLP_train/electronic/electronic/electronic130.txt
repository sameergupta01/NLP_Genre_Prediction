Trying to remember,
But my feelings can’t know for sure.
Try to reach out
But it’s gone...

Lucky stars in your eyes...
I’m walking the cow...

I really don’t know how I came here...
I really don’t know why I’m stayin’ here...
Oh, Oh, Oh. I’m walking the cow...

Tried to point my finger,
But the wind keeps blowin’ me around
In circles...circles...

Lucky stars in your eyes...
I’m walking the cow...

I really don’t know what I have to fear...
I really don’t know why I have to care...
Oh, Oh, Oh. I’m walkin’ the cow...
Lucky stars in your eyes...
