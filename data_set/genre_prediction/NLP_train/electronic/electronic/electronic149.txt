I don't call it love
Come take me in your heart
Oh, I can't get enough
I know we will never part
We are nightbirds my baby
Nightbirds will never stop
Oh, you're playing with fire
Lost in my desire
Baby, you're so hot


My bed is too big
Too big without you, baby
I wanna have your body
Come gimme what you've got
My bed is too big
Too big without you, lady
I wanna have no heartache
Come hit me with your shot


In a world of stone
Love'll never been the same
I hate to be alone - tired of playing games
You like cochtails at midnight
Diamonds and silver a lot
You're a woman behind me
Oh, set my heart free
Baby, you're so hot
