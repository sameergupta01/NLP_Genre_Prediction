Sun slink down say,
Oh such a sexy time of day.
For those who call it romance
Haven't learnt bout the
Nature of those rays?
They put some warmth in your spirit
And a twinkle in your step,
When you sing there's an angel,
But your devil has been kept
For these nights where the sun still shine
Long after it has set.

Manic, magic, mayhem, mr might be moving massive your desire,
She shot the two tequilas wipes her lip
And starts a beaming behind that savage smile.
I wanted to write a love song eh,
But the night time sun said it's time for play.
If these two eyes could make a sound
Then this is what they'd say...

Dream-like moments find us
With a flash they Blind us shining feline tears.
They touch you where it's soft
Then make us mad with that music spear.
We cry tonight if it did end us
We'd have laughed ourselves to death,
Then our souls would find that shakedown
Find that heaven in our chest,
In these nights where the sun still shine
Long after it has set.

Looking, listening, lunaticing, loving, living, lusting it's divine,
We saw the sign it said a boom shak
From the window in the sky.
I wanted to write a love song eh,
But the night time sun said it's time for play.
If these two eyes could make a sound
Then this is what they'd say...

I wanted to write a love song eh,
But the night time sun said it's time for play.
If these two eyes could make a sound
Then this is what they'd say...
THE CAT EMPIRE!
