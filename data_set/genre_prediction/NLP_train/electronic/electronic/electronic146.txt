The kombucha mushroom people
Sitting around all day.
Who can believe you,

Let your mother pray.

Well I'm not there all the time, you know,
Some people, some people, some people
Call it insane! Yeah they call it insane, (Sugar)
I play Russian roulette everyday, a man's sport,
With a bullet called life, yeah mama, called life, (Sugar)
You know that every time I try to go
Where I really wanna be,
It's already where I am,
'Cause I'm already there… (Sugar)

The kombucha mushroom people
Sitting around all day.
Who can believe you,

I got a gun the other day from Sako,
It's cute, small, fits right in my pocket,
Yeah, right in my pocket. (Sugar)
My girl, you know, she lashes out at me sometimes,
And I just fucking kick her, and then, oh baby, she's O.K. (Sugar)
People are always chasing me down,
Trying to push my face to the ground,
Where all they really want to do,
Is suck out my motherfucking brains, my brains. (Sugar)

The kombucha mushroom people
Sitting around all day.
Who can believe you,
Who can believe you,
Let your mother pray.

I sit in my desolate room, no lights, no music,
Just anger, I've killed everyone,
I'm going away forever, but I'm feeling better.
How do I feel, what do I say?
Fuck you, it all goes away!
How do I feel, what do I say?
Fuck you, it all goes away!
How do I feel, what do I say?
In the end it all goes away,
How do I feel, what do I say?
In the end it all goes away,
How do I feel, what do I say?
In the end it all goes away,
How do I feel, what do I say?
In the end it all goes away,
How do I feel, what do I say?
In the end it all goes away,
How do I feel, what do I say?
In the end it all goes away,
In the end it all goes away,
In the end it all goes away,
In the end it all goes away,
In the end it all goes away.
