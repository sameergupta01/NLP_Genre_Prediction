The Album is called "Pride"

I saw you dancing,
And I'll never be the same again, for sure;
I saw you dancing;
Say Yaki-Da, my love.
I saw you dancing,
And I'll never be the same again, for sure;
I saw you dancing;
Say Yaki-Da.

I'm waiting for a chance,
To get to know you;
To ask for a dance,
Just look into my eyes,
And I'll take you to paradise.

I saw you dancing,
And I'll never be the same again, for sure;
I saw you dancing;
Say Yaki-Da, my love.
I saw you dancing,
And I'll never be the same again, for sure;
I saw you dancing;
Say Yaki-Da.

I'm falling, I'm falling;
'Cause life is not easy for me.

Please, touch me like you do;
To have you near me,
To go where you go;
Why waste a lot of time?
My love is not a secret crime.

I saw you dancing,
And I'll never be the same again, for sure;
I saw you dancing;
Say Yaki-Da, my love.
I saw you dancing,
And I'll never be the same again, for sure;
I saw you dancing;
Say Yaki-Da.

I'm falling to pieces;
Who do you think you are?
Maybe, I've gone too far;
Maybe, I'm in love with you;
Don't hurt me or treat me bad,
'Cause I will fight for what is mine;
Say Yaki-Da...

'Cause life is meant for living.

I saw you dancing...
