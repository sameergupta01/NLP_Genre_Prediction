Sometimes it's not the giving
When what's given is gone and for free
But in taking what it took from me
And I'm not living
In someone else's eyes I am lived
Recreated in expectation so once again I'm missed
And left

Far, far away from you

The only way out is through myself to you
With words that do no justice but what have I left to use?
Because I can't stand this silence, it speaks too loud for me
A song that fails and fails me once again denied release
And left

Words, words away from you
From where my heart wants to be

Is there a beauty in promises broken?
