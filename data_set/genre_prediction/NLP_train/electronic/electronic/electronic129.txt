Running water

Where are you running from?

You always seem to be on the run!



And you never change

No matter what you do

You always wind up the same

Never knowing where you go

Always running

Never stopping to see where you are at

Never looking back

Nothing seems to slow you down

What are you running from?

You always seem to be on the run!
