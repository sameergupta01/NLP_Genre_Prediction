just another night, another bar, another town, i was talking to myself though the guys were all around, then she walked up started dancing on the bar, i showed her to my car, all her high school friends started coming to our shows, i admit they caught my eye and my wallet and my nose, but no one comes close to the girl that i loved first, maybe i'm just cursed, officer i swear she said she's 19, didn't check her id, you know that you would do the same, finally a girl who looks up to me, she can't see through me, she can't see anything i don't want her to see, we always manage to agree, finally i saw the light we didn't have to wait, come on darling pack your bags we'll move to another state, new mexico says you can marry at 16, now i got my mini-queen, in new mexico life is dry there's not much grass, and my little cutie earns our rent she's pumping gas, this morning she met the cutest girl at a bar, guess we have to move to utah
