As your heart i'll be with you
But in pain 'cause this things
I'm with you but not in you
In the place i should be

As your heart i beat for you
But you woun't beat with me
I'm ashamed of you
'Cause you've put me in your mind
Oh, what a shame

As your heart i'm a prisoner
Trapped behind bars of your mind
I'm not guilty, so it's a pity
That you won't let me through
