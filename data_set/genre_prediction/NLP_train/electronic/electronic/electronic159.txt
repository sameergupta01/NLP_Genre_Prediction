The crowds roll by, and I'm falling in
Everyone's invisible, but it's just pretend

And we all freaked out, what a shame
When only tears know how
To remind us we all break the same

We all break the same
And we all break the same

And everything we've built could be our demise
It's the sticks and stones that wear us down
That often save our lives

And we all freaked out
What a shame
When only tears know how
To remind us we all break the same

We all break the same
And we all break the same

The different stars tonight
Will somehow fade the same
And all the tears we cry
Tell us were made the same
And when we fall aside
Let's hope we fall in place
We built our different lives
But they all break the same

Break the same
Break the same
We all do
We all break the same

And we all freaked out
What a shame
When only tears know how
To remind us we all break the same

And we all break the same
And we all freaked out
What a shame
And we all freaked out
What a shame

All break the same
We all break the same
We all do

And we all break the same
And we all, we all break the same

Oh, different worlds
And different hearts
And different souls
And different parts
And we all, we all break the same

We all break the same
We all break the same
