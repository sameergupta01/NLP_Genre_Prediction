

You cam eto me in a dream
all the qualities I asked for
in a man
just understand me
love me as you know me
I'll let yo know me well
I don't anticipate putting up a gate
or shelter around my heart.
I intend to find the good in side
promise the real you
so pure
so I can give you

&lt;chorus&gt;
Butterflykisses
and pleasure you can feel
I'll daze you, even bathe you
If you remain to keep it real

If you love me, love my mother;
Know you my father
hang with my brother.
Don't discriminate
or isolate me,
please let me be myself
I want to wear what I want to wear
and say whats on my mind.
Please be kind
so I can give you

&lt;chorus&gt;
Butterflykisses
and pleasure you can feel
I'll daze you, even bathe you
If you remain to keep it real

Now that you're here
My visions clear.
i'm drenched in love.
Fly like a dove,
and walking through my life with you
is a blessin oh so sweet-

&lt;chorus&gt;
Butterflykisses
and pleasure you can feel
I'll daze you, even bathe you
If you remain to keep it real
