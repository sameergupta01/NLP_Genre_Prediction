valentine
hard to find
love is blind
acquaintances can be unkind

state of mind
show a sign
hope divine
just making love to pass the time

used to get high just to pass the time
music and wine were the only friends of mine
used to make love just to have a laugh
music and wine were the only friends i had

bitter break
hard to take
hearts'll ache
this loneliness is hard to face

hollow soul
freezing cold
feelin' older
and poverty will take it's toll

used to get high just to pass the time
music and wine were the only friends of mine
used to make love just to have a laugh
music and wine were the only friends i had

gin and lime
summertime
starry nights
and memories of better times

ocean breeze
wind in leaves
waking dream
alive with possibility

here's that lovin' here's that lovin'
this love's for real that lovin' here's that lovin'
