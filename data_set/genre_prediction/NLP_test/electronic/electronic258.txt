I spent 48 dollars last night at the county fair
I throwed out my shoulder, but I won her that teddy bear
She's got me sayin' "Sugar Pie", "Honey", "Darlin'", and "Dear"
I ain't seen the Braves play a game all year
I'm gonna get fired if I don't get some sleep
My long lost buddies say I'm getting in too deep

(CHORUS)
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
I don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

My mamma and daddy tried to teach me courtesy
But it never sank in 'till that girl got a hold of me
Now I'm holdin' umbrellas, and opening up doors
I'm taking out the trash and I'm sweeping my floor
I'm crossing my fingers, and counting every kiss
Prayin' that it keeps goin' on like this

Cause I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
I don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

I gotta wash my truck
And dress up
Pick her up to watch TV
When she sits down on the sofa
She'll move a little closer
She can't get enough of me

And I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
I don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
