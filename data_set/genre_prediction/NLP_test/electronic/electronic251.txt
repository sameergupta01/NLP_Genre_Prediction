Sometimes I'm a liar,
Sometimes I'm a fake.
Sometimes I'm a hypocrite
Everybody hates.

Sometimes I'm a poet,
Sometimes I'm a preacher
Sometimes I watch life go by
sittin' on the bleachers.

But I've never been left alone
in any problem that I've known
Even though I'm to blame
There were times when things were dark
and I've been known to miss the mark
But someone fixed my aim
Sometimes I'm a man of God
Sometimes I'm alright
Sometimes I lay down,
close my eyes and pray to God

Sometimes I don't feel good
It's hard to start the day
It's hard to climb the obstacles
that sometimes come my way

If I make it, I'm a good man,
Am I a bad man if I fail?
I know I'm never good enough
so I let grace prevail

I'm ready for the night
Right now I'm alright
Right now I'm alright
Sometimes I'm alright
I'm alright
I'm alright
Thank God
Thank God

Sometimes I'm a man of God
Sometimes I'm alright
Sometimes I lay down,
close my eyes and pray to God

Sometimes I'm a man of God
Sometimes I'm alright
Sometimes I lay down,
close my eyes and pray to God
I'm ready for the night.
