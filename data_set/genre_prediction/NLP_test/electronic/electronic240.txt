No doubt I'm the one your mama
Warned you about
I'm known for taking ladies home
And turning them out.
Like kissing all the girlies and
Making them cry.
I'm a wise guy with wits
The opposite of shy
Make your girl?s pussy shiver
When she looks in my eyes.
So uh.
One?s for the money,
Two's for the honeys
Three?s for the pimp?s players
And the playboy bunnies.
You best believe I throw down.
Ain't no need to slow down
You name the place and the time.
Find Mr. Shifty at the showdown.
Tearing you up.
That's why all the fly girls
Just can't get enough.
Said I loved you,
And you believed it was true.
That's hilarious.
But your mother should have
Warned you about
Guys like us.

Freak, freak y'all
Yeah, you know what I'm saying.
'Cause players only love you
When we're playing

CHORUS:
Now players only love you
when we're playing.
These women,
They will come
And they will go.
And all you players know just
What I'm saying
It's amazing just how many
Girls we know.

I know it ain't right.
But I don't want to change.
I've got so many dames,
I can't remember their names.
But don't be confused,
'Cause girls are players too.
So, we're going to tell you
About a girl we knew.
She was a pretty rebel.
A punk rock girl.
With a wicked sex drive
And the mind of a devil.
Like Agent 99,
Under cover all the time.
You want another kiss
You better rack another line.
Unique in design,
This freak was kind of fine.
But she's not the only one.
There's plenty of her kind.
Ain't nothing funny baby,
Her game?s so tight,
She can make the sun shine
In the middle of the night.
She knows what she wants
And she gets it when
she wants it.
She knows that you want it
She's got it, so she flaunts it.
So, get up on it.
You know the old saying.
Players only love you
When they're playing.

CHORUS

Only the strong survive
I come alive and hit my mark.
The after dark player caper
Can't lie, I'm on the take.
A heartbreaker tonight.
The ladies call me Mr. Right.
And others call me a freak.
Girl, it's okay if you bite.
Some like it violent.
Mr. Mysterious type
Strong and silent
King player
I cast a hex
Inebriated talk of sex.

(Epic, I'm so into you)

Manipulation
I'm talking triple X rated
Sophisticated,
I'm game to elevate your mind.
An understated flirt
The chemistry?s hot.
You can't deny.
So realize the size of it.
I can see it in your eyes.
I'd love to touch you baby.
And taste the essence of you.

You want to play?
Now, let me hear you scream
Out my name.
Players only love you when
they're playing.

CHORUS
