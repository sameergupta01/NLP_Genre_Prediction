Every where I go,
they're starin' at her,
every man I know.
He wants to have her
I guess I outta be a jealous man.

I look the other way
they're hittin` on her every night and day
they telephone her
they try and get to her
but I know they can't

[chorus]
Cuz she never lets it go
to her heart
she never lets it go
that far
when they start talkin'
she starts walkin'
right back to my arms
she can turn every head
but she never lets it go to her heart.

She walks into the room
and everybody watches every move
hopin' she don't love me
I know it by the way
they hang around.
but they don't realize
there's more to her than what meets the eye
that's why i'm certain
that no matter what they do
to reach her now

[chorus]
cuz she never lets it go
to her heart
she never lets it go
that far
when they start talkin'
she starts walkin'
right back to my arms
she can turn every head
but she never lets it go to her heart

she never lets it go to her heart

(repeat chorus until fades)
