
Death is on the Midway
Gambling with souls
Roulette on the wire
Ace is in the hole
I sink beneath the feeling
Moon is in my hands
A crooked wheel of Twenty-One
I just don't understand - NO!
Laugh - Yeah - Drown and Laugh
Your life is over

If God is the dealer
why do we never win?
A bloody mix of silk and mud
that starts all over again
NO - Laugh - Yeah -
Drown and Laugh -
Your life is over!!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

Clowns - they scare
The children
Roll around the
The ring - The
Animals they
Wanna kill
Anyone - Anything
Laugh - Yeah
Drown and
Laugh -
Your life is over!!
