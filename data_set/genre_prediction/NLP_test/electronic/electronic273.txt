
Lookin out a dirty old window,
Down below the cars in the city go rushing by,
I see it here alone and I wonder why,
Friday night and everyone's moving.
I can feel the heat but its soothing heading down,
I search for the beat in this dirty town,

Downtown the young ones are going,
Downtown the young ones are growing

We're the kids in america,
We're the kids in america,
Everybody live for the music around

Bright Lights,
The music gets faster,
Look boy don't check on your watch, Not another glance,
I'm not leaving now honey not a chance,
Hot shot give me no problems,
Much later baby you'll be, saying "nevermind,"
You know life is cruel,
Life is never kind

Kind hearts don't make a new story,
Kind hearts don't grab any glory

We're the kids in america,
We're the kids in america,
Everybody live for the music around

Come closer honey thats better,
Gotta get a brand new experience feelin right,
Oh, don't try to stop baby hold me tight,
Outside a new day is dawning,
Outside suburbia calling, everywhere,
I don't want to go baby,
New York to East California,
There's a new way come in on ya

We're the kids in america,
We're the kids in america,
Everybody live for the music around
