
whenever the game is played
you rain on my parade
darlin' you, you always win

and still I aplogize
all that twinkle in your eyes
baby you, you always win

when lovers on high go strollin' by
what am I to do?
they start a-whisperin' nothin's
make me think about somethin'
makin' sweet love to you

I know before we begin
and all the results are in
baby you, you always win

when lovers on high go strollin' by
what am I to do?
they start a-whisperin' nothin's
make me think about somethin'
makin' sweet love to you

I know before we begin
and all the results are in
baby you, you always win

baby you, you always win
always win
you always win
always win
you always win
always win...
