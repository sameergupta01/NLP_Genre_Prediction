Mary Jane says it's all right
She's just around the corner from the main light.
Any day now, it's all right
She's standing on the precipice of big time.
And I know I'm a little uptight,
I've got to go before the sun shines.
We're just a couple small people squeezing out a life,
We need a little good time.
It's not far from the edge,
Mary comes and goes.
Drifting through the scenery of the shallow days below,
That is anybody knows.
You follow trains out of town and they vanish somewhere under the horizon.
Yeah well I saw Mary Jane dragged her shadow down the tracks, Stare off in the distance.
It's not far from here,
Mary waves hello.
Smiling though she's sinking in the shallow days below,
I can't find a way out of here.
Out on the road again,
I'm much, much too concerned about Mary Jane.
I'm all alone again,
I like what she said, not what it means.
She leaves me drowning through the shallow days, down below.
You know I heard a band playing waltzes in a grange hall
The sun is sinking lower.
People staring, Mary Jane humming softly to herself,
Nobody really knows her.
Any day now it's all right,
She tells herself that this will be the last time.
Mary Jane pulls her hair back and wonders what she'll do with all her free time.
Not too far from here,
Mary turns to go.
Smiling while the waltz begins, dancing down the road
Hey hey Mr. Freedom,
What are we supposed to think?
'Cause I'm a very tiny person and it worries me.
I'm all alone again,
I like what she says, not what it means.
She leaves me drowning in the shallow days way down below.
"I'm sorry", she said,
"I know it's not the kind of thing you want."
I'm falling, falling down.
"I'm sorry", she said.
"I know I'm not the kind of girl you want."
We're falling, falling, falling, falling down.
