There was only one long and terrible winter
Where icy blackness covered the sun and the grass
Dethroned light ended its existence
Hell brought there all thunders and winds
All the blasphemy from the four sides of the world
Gods have forgotten this land, where fear
Caught the throat with the bony hand
And the wolf howled gloomy song of cold, frost and hunger...
The lakes enslaved in hard icy shackles
Wild trees covered the happy world
Which will never wake up again !
Life has affected a new form here
Through the icy vastlands run wild
Hordes of wolves, moonless night, that's all
Moon is covered with fresh meat, threw by the hungry hordes
