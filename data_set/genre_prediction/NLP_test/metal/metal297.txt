A lesson in democracy,I will never,never be,A
servant of a moral standard,a rebelsoul for the free,
I scream and I burn,I deny what I've learned,Can't
fight what's inside,on this blasphemous ride,Here I
stand!!

[Chorus:]
Cause he will remain,will remain the same,he's
apart of the game and he will remain

As I cry for more,The angels burn their core,Let the
evil saints have their way,When I'm heading for
oblivion.Achieving my goals in everyway,In
malicious ways I hail the insane,Nevertheless:my
broken promises,I scream and I burn,I deny what
I've learned Can't fight what's inside,on this
blasphemous ride,here I fall!

[Chorus]

Now,take a look at the predator's portrait
Cause these walls are closing in!

Now,take a look at the predator's portrait
Cause these walls come tumbling down [x2]

Come watch me bleed one more time!,No
substitute left to find!,All that I hear is what I
preach!,A mighty soul is what I keep!

I step on the face whose dragging me down,Fed up
with the precious talk,Like a sinner revealing
himself again,Now his down and out,and ready to
strike,his ready to strike,his ready to strike,to clear
his very inside

[Chorus x2]
