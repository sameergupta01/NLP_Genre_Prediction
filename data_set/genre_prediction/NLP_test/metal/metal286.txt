Everybody sat here waiting for the train to come
Just laid down a bright-red carpet for her to step on'
Looking through the band I see her waving her hands at me
Her looks were tanned and quite amazing as she ran to me

Hello Susie, hello Susie
Tell me the news about yourself
Hello Susie, hello Susie
Tell me that you've enjoyed yourself

Frantically she knocked me over causing such a scene
Shook the crowd enough to sway the interest from the Queen
Her black transistor socked out one o' clock radio
Completely drowned the band and loud enough to stop the show

Hello Susie, hello Susie
Tell me the news about yourself
Hello Susie, hello Susie
Tell me that you've enjoyed yourself

Yes sir, rock and roll the day away
Come on everybody
They all seem too keen to make a scene
Come on everybody, gotta kick the dust away

Hello Susie, hello Susie
Tell me the news about yourself
Hello Susie, hello Susie
Tell me that you've enjoyed yourself

Hello Susie, hello Susie
Tell me the news about yourself
Hello Susie, hello Susie
Tell me that you've enjoyed yourself

Hello Susie, hello Susie
Tell me the news about yourself
