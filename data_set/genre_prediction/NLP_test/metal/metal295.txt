Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
And I say it's all right

Little darlin'
It's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darlin'
It feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
And I say it's all right

Little darlin'
The smiles returning to their faces
Little darlin'
It seems like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
And I say it's all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes

Little darlin'
It seems like years since it's been clear
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
And I say it's all right

Little darlin'
I feel the ice is slowly meltin'

Little darlin'
It seems like years since it's been near
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
And I say it's all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
