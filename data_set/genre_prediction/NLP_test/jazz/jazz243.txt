
Look at me
Look into my eyes
Tell me do you see
That i am always by your side

Or has the world got you down
On your knees
Come to me

Look at you 
Look into your heart
Tell me is there room for you
To make a brand new start

Or has the world gotten to you
And made you dark
Come to me

Cause' when you cry
All your tears I will wipe away
When you laugh
Who do you think got you that way

When your dreaming
And you wake up
Is it me you wanna see
(Repeat)

Look at us 
Look around the world
Cause all you seem to find
Are unhappy boys and unhappy girls

Now tell me
Is that what you want
For you and me
Dont you want to be happy

(Repeat chorus)

Look at me Look into my eyes
Tell me do you see that I 
Am always by your side
Or has the world got you down
On your knees
Lookin' commonly

You know you can always
Count on me
