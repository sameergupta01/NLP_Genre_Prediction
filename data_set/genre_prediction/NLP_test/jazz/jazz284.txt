
I catch a fly in my hand
My knuckles go white
I wanted to fly
It didn't help me understand
But it sure felt good to hold

Heavy change is what i need
No bag of silver with a smiling queen
I got a spider in a box you see
Someday i'll take a little sum for me

From Rome to my very hand
Slipping through like each grain of sand
I open letters to the sound of air
But, aw get away i don't want to share

Chorus

Look for the silver theres a finders fee
And theres an acre for every tree
I wanna go share it around
I drop a penny and i hear no sound

I close the box, hide it away
And put a value on their currency
Thats ten to them for every one to me
Swollow the key for another day

Chorus

Its through the nose, this shit is true
My favourite letters, I.O.U
I cut some feathers with some amber beads
I got an empty bag of some whales teeth
Show me the blood to pasify
Its what makes mothers leave to babies cry
I wanna go share all around
I change the time for every pound of pounds
