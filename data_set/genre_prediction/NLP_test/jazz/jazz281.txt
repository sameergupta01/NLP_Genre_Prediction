Uh uh uh...

Full moon
Make this night
Love will 
Heal the wound
The glowing light
Will make things right
It's alright

Full moon
Wait in vain
Love for sure
Will come with rain
Rain for sure
Will make it right
It's alright

Uh uh uh...
(Repeat)

It's alright
It's alright...
(repeat)

Dark Sky - rinse me with rain and I'll cry
Love tears blurring my sight, it's alright
Filled up and want to be empty
Rinse Me
(repeat)

Uh uh uh...
