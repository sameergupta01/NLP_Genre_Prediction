

Sit yourself down, girl, and talk to me
Tell me what's on your mind
Don't keep on telling me everything's ok
'Cause if you were then you wouldn't be crying

You've been tossing and turning in your sleep lately
Sitting around pouting all day long
How in the world do you expect for me to understand, baby
When I don't even know what's wrong?

Let's straighten it out, baby
Let's straighten it out
Baby, baby, let's straighten it out
We can always straighten it out

For the last five nights honey, when we went to bed
Whoah, I could tell something just wasn't right
When you turn your back to me and cover your head
Or you didn't even say goodnight

Now if you you're tired and don't want to be bothered, baby
Say the word and I'll leave you alone
Instead of lying there crying your eyes out honey
You and me ought to be getting it on

Let's straighten it out, baby
Let's straighten it out
We can always straighten it out
You know we can straighten it out

How in the world do you expect for me to understand you, baby
When I don't even know what's wrong?
But I believe we can straighten it out
Come here and lay in my arms and let me straiten it out
Talk to me, whisper to me straighten it out baby
