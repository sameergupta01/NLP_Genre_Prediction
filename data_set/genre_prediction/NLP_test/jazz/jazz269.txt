

I've been down so low people look at me and they know
They can tell something is wrong
Like I don't belong
Well, staring through a window, standing outside they're just too happy to care
Tonight I wanna be like them but I'll mess it up again
I tripped on my way in, got kicked outside, everybody saw

(Chorus)
And I know that it's a wonderful world
But I can't feel it right now
Well I thought that I was doing well but I just want to cry now
Well I know that it's a wonderful world from the sky down to the sea
But I can only see it when you're here, here with me

Sometimes I feel so full of love, it just comes spilling out
It's uncomfortable to see I give it away so easily
But if I had someone I would do anything and never, never, never let you feel alone
I won't, I won't leave you on your own
Who am I to dream? Dreams are for fools, they let you down

(Chorus)

And I wish that I could make it better
I'd give anything for you to call me
Maybe just a little letter
Oh, it could start again

(Chorus)

And I know that it's a wonderful world
I can't feel it right now
I've got all the right clothes to wear
I just want to cry now, cry now
Well I know that it's a wonderful world from the sky down to the sea
I can only see when you're here, here with me

And I know that it's a wonderful world
When you're with me
