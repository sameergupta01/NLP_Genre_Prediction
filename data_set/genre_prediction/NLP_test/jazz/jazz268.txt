
Uh-huh

Little angels, whisper softly
While my heart melts for you and I see
Only sunshine
Only moonlight
For the first time, it's real and
The higher you take me, the more that you make me
Feel so hazy, tell me what this means

I got jet lag and I never even left the ground
See it's like that everytime you come around ooh
I'm so hungover, and I never even touched a drop
See, I can't get enough 
This must be love

How the time flies, when you're near me
I get those butterflies inside and all day
where the sunshines, where the birds fly
'Til the next time you're mine and
The higher you take me, the more that you make me
Feel so hazy, tell me what this means

I got jet lag and I never even left the ground
See it's like that everytime you come around ooh
I'm so hungover, and I never even touched a drop
See, I can't get enough 
This must be love

Taken over me
It feels like gravity
Aint got no hold on me
Tell me what this means
This must be looooove looooove

Jet lag and I never even left the ground
See it's like that everytime you come around ooh
I'm so hungover, and I never even touched a drop
See, I can't get enough 
This must be love

Baby don't know you really really got it going on
Baby don't know you really really got it going on
Baby don't know you really really got it going on
Baby don't know you really really got it going on

Baby don't know you really really got it going on
Baby don't know you really really got it going on
Baby don't know you really really got it going on
Baby don't know you really really got it going on

See I never even left the ground
I never even touched one drop, one drop
See, I got jet lag, jet lag
