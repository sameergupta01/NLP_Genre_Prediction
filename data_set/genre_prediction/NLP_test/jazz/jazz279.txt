
Lip up fatty, ah lip up fatty, for the reggae,
Lip up fatty, ah lip up fatty, for the reggae,

Listen to the music, shuffle up your feet,
Listen to the music of the fatty beat.

Moving with the rhythm, sweating with the heat,
Moving with the rhythm of the fatty beat.

Lip up fatty, ah lip up fatty, for the reggae,
Trumpeet.

Listen to the music, shuffle up your feet,
Listen to the music of the fatty beat.

Lip up fatty, ah lip up fatty, for the reggae,
Trumpeet.

Lip up fatty, ah lip up fatty, for the reggae,
Don't call me fat man,
Lip up fatty, ah lip up fatty, for the reggae,
Fat man don't like you.
