
To get up and walk away
Would be too easy
So stay and stand your ground
Just watch your mouth with me

On the back of every right
There's a wrong looming
So here you and I should tread as soft as these
Razor blades for boots will let be

Have you ever tried to step in my shoes?
Have you ever tried to balance that beam?
And if you ever try to fit in my shoes
They'll never be quite as soft as they seem

Thought, unabashed honesty
Would be ideal
But a prophet did once say
That honesty is a lonely word

So where do we go from here
Abandon ship now?
My problem is you make me melt
And I don't want to be frozen anymore

Have you ever tried to step in my shoes?
Have you ever tried to balance that beam?
And if you ever try to fit in my shoes
They'll never be quite as soft as they seem

Have you ever
Have you ever tried to
I have never
I have never tried to

Have you ever tried to step in my shoes?
Have you ever tried to balance that beam?
And if you ever try to fit in my shoes
They'll never be quite as soft as they seem
