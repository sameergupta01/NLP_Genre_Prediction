
I put this shovel down
Hire me on better grounds
I can't afford no gas
I walk to work on the overpass
My teenage daughter's knocked up
Well jeanie this time you really fucked up
You aughtta be in the hospital
But I can't afford to go, the bill

Hey hey revolver
Don't lead me on
Your shiny barrel
Is long and narrow
Hey hey Revolver

I put this shovel down
I walk the line into Hudson town
The blue burger king billboard signs Remind me of her mother's eyes
She ran off to be a T.V. star
I hope she found what she was lookin for
I promised Jeanie she'd see L.A.
If I ever made some cash someday

Hey hey revolver
Don't lead me on
Your shiny barrel
Is long and narrow
Hey hey Revolver
