
Another humdrum grey day
i wonder if this rain passed toledo
and if so i hope it left a sunny day through your window
i can't make shape or form
of this new emotion

i need a drive up san francisco bay
i'd write this song on the way
i'm not sure i belong here anyway
she thinks that i've already gone away

another hum drum grey day
maybe i'll head out for a movie
the day is always so bright
after a matinee
wouldn't you say?

i need a drive up san francisco bay
i'd write this song on the way
i'm not sure i belong here anyway
she thinks that i've already gone away

yeah i figure one day i'll snap out of this
yeah one day soon i'll pull my head down out of outer-space
yeah i figure one day i'll snap out of this
yeah one day soon i'll take that drive out
