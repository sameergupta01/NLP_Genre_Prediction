
Did you hear about Saint Stephen's end,
how they stoned by the river bend?
And the morning sun,
when the world was young.

Did you hear about the elephant?
Ran wild from the circus tent,
killed a crowd of ten,
before they shot him dead.

Oh Mary, don't you cry,
please lay your weary hand in mine.

Did you hear about Edith Cavell
how on the firing line she fell?
In a Belgian night,
in a dress of white.

Oh Mary, don't you cry,
please lay your weary hand in mine.
And swing low and softly down,
and lend me your ear.

Did you hear about Saint Peter's crown,
how they crucified him upside down?
And the desert air,
when the world was fair.

Oh Mary, don't you cry,
please lay your weary hand in mine.
And swing low and softly down,
and lend me your ear, Mary dear
