O Lord my God When I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made
I see the stars I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout the universe displayed

Then sings my soul My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art, How great Thou art
Then sings my soul My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art, How great Thou art

When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
And take me home what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow in humble adoration
And there proclaim My God how great Thou art

Then sings my soul My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art, How great Thou art
Then sings my soul My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art, How great Thou art

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art, How great Thou art
