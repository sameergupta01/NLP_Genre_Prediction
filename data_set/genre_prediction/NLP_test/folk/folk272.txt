
Little Ann's in the kitchen in her modern gown
With the rainy weather coming down
Oh the radio does play
I could sweep you off your feet
But you're two teary eyed to even know

Little Ann, Little Ann let that stormy weather go
From your front door to the heart of Chicago

Oh the lightning and the thunder
Are rolling in the sky
Coming down just like your teary eyes
Oh Annie don't you cry
If youre crying for me, when you're gone I'll find some company

Little Ann, Little Ann let that stormy weather go
From your front door to the heart of Chicago
Little Ann, Little Ann let that stormy weather go
From your troubled mind to the heart of Chicago
