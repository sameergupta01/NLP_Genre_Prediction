
Blind me with distraction
Build a frontier ‘cross the void
All tomorrow been destroyed, in a breath

I moved out to the country
And I saw the scenery shake
As a summer parade meets it’s death
And God’s assassins rode back into town
And paved their way upon the cold, cold ground

Roses help me to pretend
Blushing brides and cosmonauts
Don’t meet their bitter end

Give me grace oh Mother
I have rumbled quite a feast
Traced the footsteps of a Priest in the snow

But in my mind’s picture of every face I’ve ever loved
Travel lightly suck their blood before they go

And God’s assassins rode back into town
And paved their way upon the cold, cold ground

Roses help me to pretend
Blushing brides and cosmonauts
Don’t meet their bitter end

Roses, roses, cannot do this any more
