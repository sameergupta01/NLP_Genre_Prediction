
By rights we should have been choking 
On every word the Preacher had us repeat 
A stiff drink and napkins in your hand bag 
The first aid of a three-time divorcee 

Carried you home down through the subway 
Where thrills are cheap and the kids roll down walls 
Like paint 
Borrowed Gods been rubbing their backs on your window 
Your summers are haunted with memories of love sick 
Strays 

Pick up your chin there's a Saint on the mend 
On a burnt out estate born of bones that don't bend 
Coming back stealing hearts pulling through 
Brand fire new 

Mary goes a-diving in at the deep end 
At the sliding doors of the 13th floor she prays 
She says night fall gently on the weekend 
When tempers are high and all those frustrations 
Displayed 

Pick up your chin there's a Saint on the mend 
On a burnt out estate born of bones that don't bend 
Coming back stealing hearts pulling through 
Brand fire new 

Pick up your chin there's a Saint on the mend 
On a burnt out estate born of bones that don't bend 
Coming back stealing hearts pulling through 
Brand fire new 

I'm hit, I'm down, I'm done, I'm dusted, I'm deadbeat 
I am weak as a kitten, been strapped to the tracks of a 
Train 
I have danced with the drunks, and dodged all those 
Filthy old whispers 
But baby go give 'em hell and tell 'em it came with a 
Name  

Brand fire new
