
My heart ain't broken 'cause that implies
It was ever in one piece before tonight

Paradise is poison in my veins
Winter runs its fingers through the vapours that remain

Burn your books in the car
Fix your eyes on a star
And imagine you can handle the loss
Of a beautiful girl
Wrapped in black icy curls
Though your thoughts are like broken glass dragging you down

None of these roads ever lead
Ever gonna lead to your door
God knows I've been here before and
I don't need no long walk home down a loveless parade
Seems I was born in a dead man's suit
I was born in a dead man's suit

Druken old Olympian in the blocks
Lousy on the trigger and his eye ain't on the clock
Feed me like a monkey and I'll swing
Deep inside the canopy where fire and ice are king

Burn your books in the car
Fix your eyes on a star
And imagine you can handle the loss
Of a beautiful girl
Wrapped in black icy curls
Though your thoughts are like broken glass dragging you down

None of these roads ever lead
Ever gonna lead to your door
God knows I've been here before and
I don't need no long walk home down a loveless parade
Seems I was born in a dead man's suit
I was born in a dead man's suit

Sister quick pull the cord
There's a horse on the ward
With a mouthful of diamonds for teeth
In a dusty old cape stands a man in its wake
Singing I got a woman that loves like an ocean and

None of these roads ever lead
Ever gonna lead to your door
God knows I've been here before and
I don't need no long walk home down a loveless parade
Seems I was born in a dead man's suit
I was born in a dead man's suit

Under trees that bear no fruit
