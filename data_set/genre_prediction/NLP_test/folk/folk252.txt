

Dropped by your house today
My spiral down is over
Everyone is gonna say
That I am in way over my head
my head

And I don't think that you'd believe
The things that i've been up to
Since you went away
I think that we are even steven
Steven

And I'm amazed at how you fumble
Through saying the things that you do
I don't know how you do it
but you do it
you do it

Drove by my life the other day
It looked like it was over
Since you went away
But I am a day older
And it's almost may
It's almost may

And I'm amazed at how you fumble
Through saying the things that you do
I don't know how you do it
but you do it
you do it
