
The turbines pound, your plane touches down, the captain catches your eye
And all the city crows perched high in rows on wires watch you walk by
Your hair has changed, your room's rearranged, someone's been sleeping inside
And the curtain's closed on all your windows to block out the fried chicken sign

Roll on, Arte roll on
Your heart's too good for this town
Your eyes cast through the glass
At my so sorry mannequin frown

The porter sings as he begins to clean up the mess that we've made
The Christmas trees are cast on the street and garbage trucks block Hooper Lane
My head's in pain but I can't complain cause my sweetheart waits down the line
And in a while we'll be in a house by the sea, even if just in my mind

Roll on, Arte roll on
Your heart's too good for this town
Your eyes cast through the glass
At my starry American frown

My mouth ain't fed, my lips ain't cherry red and my grin my show my bad teeth
And all the people I pass, they give me glance, as if I'm some lower-class thief
But to you, I am fine, and I'm in your mind even if I'm not around
And my arms are strong and that's where you belong, given the love that we've found

Roll on, Arte roll on
Your heart's too good for this town
My eyes cast through the glass
At your so sorry Marilyn frown
