
1929 pretty women, men are dying
Call the nurse
Call the doctor
Call the priest

Because they killed the rich and poor
And they'll surely kill us all
If we don't turn away from our shame
Hospital I lie and I know I'll surely die
But I don't want to die
Please don't die
The Memphis Flu is in our bed
And it will surely kill us dead
If we don't turn away from our shame
I got Memphis flu

And the priest is in my room
and he sings my last prayer
We're in the Devil's book
And he won't need no second look
If we don't um turn away from our shame
