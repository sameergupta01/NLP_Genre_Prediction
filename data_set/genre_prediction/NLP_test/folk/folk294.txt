
well i died in penn station tonight, oh lord
well i died in penn station tonight, oh lord
in penn station tonight

with a toothbrush and a comb
five dollars and dead cell phone, oh lord
no photo i.d.
no past to torture me, oh lord
no past to torture me

well i died in penn station tonight, oh lord
well i died in penn station tonight, oh lord
in penn station tonight

oh how sweetly i do sleep
on the bathroom tile where the porters sweep
with a nickel in my hand
like the star of bethleham, oh lord
like the star of bethleham

and i know on track number seven
there's a train to take me to heaven, lord
but a faster train's coming near
that the devil engineers, oh lord
that the devil engineers

well i died in penn station tonight, oh lord
