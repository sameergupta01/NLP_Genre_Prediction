
I've tried but I couldn't find any warning of you, dear
It's hard to make any sense of what I feel here

All I know
Is that my days go on and on
Without you here, without you here
My days go on and on
Without you here, without you here

I beg your pardon, love
But you've interrupted me
And the sad song that's played
Like a drum inside of me

My, my, what a fool am I
For allowing this to be
But this fool cannot ignore
The light when he sees you

And my days go on and on
Without you here, without you here
