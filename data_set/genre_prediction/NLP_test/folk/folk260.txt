
God knows what is hiding in that weak and drunken heart 
I guess you kissed the girls and made them cry 
Those hard faced queens of misadventure 
God knows what is hiding in those weak and sunken eyes 
A fiery throng of muted angels 
Giving love and getting nothing back 

Oh People help the people 
And if you're homesick, give me your hand and I'll hold it 
People help the people 
And nothing will drag you down 
Oh and if I had a brain
Oh and if I had a brain 
I'd be cold as a stone and rich as the fool 
That turned all those good hearts away 

God knows what is hiding in that world of little consequence 
Behind the tears inside the lies 
A thousand slowly dying sunsets 
God knows what is hiding in those weak and drunken hearts 
I guess that loneliness came knocking 
No-one needs to be alone oh singing 

People help the people 
And if you're homesick give me your hand and I'll hold it 
People help the people 
Nothing will drag you down 
Oh and if I had a brain
Oh and if I had a brain 
I'd be cold as a stone and rich as the fool 
That turned all those good hearts away 

Nah nah nah ...

People help the people 
And if you're homesick give me your hand and I'll hold it 
People help the people 
Nothing will drag you down 
Oh and if I had a brain
Oh and if I had a brain 
I'd be cold as a stone and rich as the fool 
That turned all those good hearts away
