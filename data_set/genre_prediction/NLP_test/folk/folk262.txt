

Remember me with a smile on my face
Replace the tears in your memory with
Two heroic arms that twisted lids form jars
And dragged you home after drinking in the park

Remember me with the wind in my sails
Replace the Night Nurse that sits at my bedside
With a whistling heart, that played piano in the dark
And cheered you every step of the way

I still thirst for romance, I still thirst for romance, 
And the sand between my toes
Darling I, I seen demons dancing, I seen demons dancing,
across factories floors

Remember me holding court in Henry's Bar
Poking holes in the so-called Left
Buried my mother, father, sister, brother, lover
So why'd they treat me like a child?

I still thirst for romance, I still thirst for romance, 
And the sand between my toes
Darling I, I seen demons dancing, I seen demons dancing,
across factories floors

I still thirst for romance and the sand between my toes
Darling I, I seen demons dancing across these factories' floors
floors, floors.
