

Mary, do what you can
Do get me out of this
And I'll make it worth your while

Hey Tori, all of your stories
Make more sense these days
And I never wanted them
To be worth my while

I'll stand still
Go around, go around, go around...

Loui, do what you can, friend
To turn up the sound, man
And I'll make it worth their while

Robin, do what you can love
To face everything love
And one day it will all be worthwhile

I'd take all of it from you
All of it
