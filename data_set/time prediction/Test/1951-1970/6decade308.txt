
CHORUS: Workin' in a coalmine
Goin' down, down, down
Workin' in a coalmine (woop!)
About to slip down
Workin' in a coalmine
Goin' down, down, down
Workin' in a coalmine (woop!)
About to slip down]
5 o'clock in the mornin'
I'm already up and gone
Lord, I'm so tired
How long can this go on?

[chorus]

'Cause I make a lil' money
Hauling gold by the ton
But when Saturday rolls around
I'm too tired for having fun (too tired for havin')

[chorus]

Lord, I'm so tired!
How long can this go on?

[chorus]

5 o'clock in the morning
I'm already up and gone
Lord, I'm so tired
How long can this go on?
