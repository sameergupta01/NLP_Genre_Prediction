
This land is a lovely green
It reminds me of my own home
Such children I've seldom seen
Even in my own home
The sky so bright and clean
Just like my home
Kind people as have ever been
Won't you take me back to my own home

CHORUS:
Jump up behind me my love
Jump up behind me
Old Dan can bear us both
Jump up behind me
We follow this road 'til we reach the sea
Jump up behind me
We'll catch the tide and set Dan free
Jump up behind me

I've been in this world awhile
And I've seen a lot of country
Many days and many miles
All various and sundry
I've had my way and I've had my fun
And I've had my chance to run free
Burning hot beneath the sun
Freezing cold and wintry

REPEAT CHORUS

I know now
Only one thing matters in these days
One thing, true love
Love and love alone
True love

I came out of a dream last night
Thought I was back in my old home
Mom and Dad were both still alive
And the babies not yet born, no
Felt like a festival
Felt like a Christmas morning
Felt the darkness fall away
Even as the world was turning
