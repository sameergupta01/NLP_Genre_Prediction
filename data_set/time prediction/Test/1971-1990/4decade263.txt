
I saw it written and I saw it say
Pink moon is on its way
And none of you stand so tall
Pink moon gonna get you all

It's a pink moon
It's a pink moon
Pink, pink, pink, pink
Pink moon

The pink, pink, pink, pink
Pink moon

I saw it written and I saw it say
Pink moon is on its way
And none of you stand so tall
Pink moon gonna get you all

It's a pink moon
It's a pink moon
