
Train roll on
On down the line, won't you
Please take me far away

Now I feel the wind blow
Outside my door means I'm
I'm leaving my woman at home, Lordy

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Oh my baby's gone with the wind

And I don't know
Oh where I'm going
I just want to be left alone

Well when this train ends
I'll try again oh but
I'm leaving my woman at home, Lordy

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind
Train roll on
Tuesday's gone

Train roll on
Many miles from my home, see I'm
I'm riding my blues away, yeah

Well Tuesday you see
Oh she had to be free, Lord but
Somehow I got to carry on, Lordy

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind, oh
My baby's gone with the wind
Train roll on
Roll on
'Cause my baby's gone
I'm riding my blues babe
Trying to ride my blues
Ride on train
Ride on train
Ride my blues babe
Come back to me babe
Come back to me oh train
Roll on train
Wooaahh...
Ride on train
Tuesday
