
Just like the girlies back at corner stone
Wash my bugle boy a watching my throne
Sweet mutilations of a sold to nothing man
Lord, have mercy, shake is falling through your hand

Razz the kid

Because you love me, I'm the chosen one
These are the days to not be having no fun
I listen back to what you told me before
Just tell me where to come, I'll knock down the door

Razz the kid
Razz the kid

Razz the kid
Razz the kid
Razz the kid
