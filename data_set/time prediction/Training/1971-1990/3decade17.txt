

&lt;I met my love by the gas works wall
Dreamed a dream by the old canal
I kissed a girl by the factory wall
Dirty old town dirty old town

Clouds are drifting across the moon
Cats a prowling on their beat
Spring's a girl in the street at night
Dirty old town dirty old town

Heard a siren from the docks
Saw a train set the night on fire


Smelled the spring in the smokey wind
Dirty old town dirty old town

I'm going to make a good sharp axe
Shining steel tempered in the fire
Will chop you down like an old dead tree
Dirty old town dirty old town

Dirty old town dirty old town
