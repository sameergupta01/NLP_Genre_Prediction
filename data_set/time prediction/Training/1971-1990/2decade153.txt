
Way up in the sky, not a cloud is flyin' by 
A picture perfect afternoon 
Birds upon the wing, I can hear them sing 
Chirping out a happy tune 
And I'm walkin' around with my head hanging down 
Got a reason for feeling this way 
Since you've been gone things look so wrong 
The sky's got the blues today 
The sky's got the blues, just like I've got them for you 
That old sky's got the blues and I've got nothing to look up to 
Yeah, the sky's got the blues, the sky's got the blues today 

Everyone I see, happy as can be 


Loving all this warm sunshine 
So many things to do, beneath a sky of blue 
Not a worry on their minds 
Oh but I could stand a change, some clouds or some rain 
Now ain't that sad to say, but it could take a turn 
As far as I'm concerned, the sky's got the blues today 

The sky's got the blues, just like I've got them for you 
That old sky's got the blues and I've got nothing to look up to 
Yeah, the sky's got the blues, the sky's got the blues today 

Yeah, the sky's got the blues today
