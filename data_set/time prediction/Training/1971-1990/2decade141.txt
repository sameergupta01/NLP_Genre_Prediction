
Bells will be ringing the sad, sad news
Oh what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone I have no friends
To wish me greetings, once again.

Choirs will be singing "Silent Night"
Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas,
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night.

Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
For this is Christmas, yes, Christmas my dear
It's the time of year to be with the one you love.

So won't you tell me you'll never more roam
Christmas and New Year's will find you home
There'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, I'll be happy, once again.

There'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, happy Christmas, once again...
