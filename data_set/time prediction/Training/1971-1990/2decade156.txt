
There's something about your smile
There's something about the way you make me feel
Keeps me holding on
It brings me back, you know what game to play
Back into your flame
Back towards the point of no return
To see your face again

To point it out there's no one else apart from you
you drugging me with all the things you do
But you already know that I want you
But you already know that I need you

So hear me, feel me
Oh can you handle me baby (2x)
Love me, heal me
don't turn me down no (2x)
Don't you want me

So it is not that I don't care oh no
It's not that I don't give a damn no no no no I
But I don't think it's fair hey

To point it out there's no one else it's only you
can drugging me with all the things you do
But you already know that I want you
But you already know that I need you

So hear me, feel me
Oh can you handle me baby (2x)
Love me, heal me
don't turn me down no (2x)
For I need to trust you
Oh can you handle me baby (2x)
Love you always
Don't turn me down no, don't turn me down
Don't u want me? oh-oh (2x)

So hear me, feel me
Oh can you handle me baby (2x)
Love me, heal me
Don't turn me down no (2x)
For I need to trust you
Oh can you handle me baby (2x)
Love you always
Don't turn me down baby (2x)

Love me heal me
Don't turn me down  (2x)
Don't u want me?
