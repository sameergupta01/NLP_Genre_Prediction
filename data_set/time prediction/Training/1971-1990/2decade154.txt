
Can you fix this; it's a broken heart
It was fine, but it just fell apart
It was mine but now I give it to you
Cause you can fix it, you know what to do

Let your love cover me
Like a pair of angel wings
You are my family
You are my family

We stood outside in the summer rain
Different people with a common pain
A simple box in that hard red clay
Is where we left him to always remain

Let your love cover me
Like a pair of angel wings
You are my family
You are my family

A child who played with the moon and stars
Waves a snatch of hay in a common barn
In the lonely house of Adam's fall
Lies a child, he's just a child that's all

Crying'

Let your love cover me
Like a pair of angel wings
You are my family
You are my family

You are my family
You are my family
