
I was at the Lion's Lair and who did I sit next to there but Satan.
He ordered me a beer, and He looked me in the eye.
He said he was my friend, I knew that was a lie.
He's the man behind my sins I seem to fall because of Him.
Goddamn I hate Him. So this is my last song about Satan.
So I say Lucifer you piece of shit I should kick your ass right where you sit.
All the hell you put me through, my Mother cries because of You.
Now Satan didn't like that much, He said some words 'bout fire and such.
Then I found myself in burning hell, I wasn't feeling all so well.
Well this is my last song about Satan
Well I must of gone back in time, about the time after Jesus died. 
He was down there preachin' in that hole to all us dark and lonely souls.
And He said, son why are you here? You should be back home drinking beer,
writing songs about God and glory, don't use the Devil in your story.
Well this is my last song about Satan

-Reverend Dwight-Rumley-

Well I felt a knock upon my head and I woke back home in my bed.
It was a dark and dismal morning. Was this some kind of Godly warning?
So I said that's it I'm on the level, no more songs about the Devil.
Then I felt a little twinge when I realized that my hair was singed.
Well this is my last song about Satan
