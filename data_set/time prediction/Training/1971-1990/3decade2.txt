I got my first real six string
Bought it at the Five-and-Dime,
Played it 'til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69.

Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard,
Jimmy quit, Jody got married
I should've known we'd never get far.

Oh when I look back now,
That summer seemed to last forever,
And if I had the choice,
Yeah - I'd always want to be there,
Those were the best days of my life.

(Hey)
Ain't no use in complainin',
When you got a job to do,
Spent my evenin's down at the drive-in,
And that's when I met you, yeah.

Standin' on your mama's porch,
You told me that you'd wait forever,
Oh and when you held my hand,
I knew that it was now or never,
Those were the best days of my life - oh yeah,
Back in the summer of '69 - oh

Man, we were killin' time
We were young and restless,
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever - forever, no.

And now the times are changin',
Look at everything that's come and gone,
Sometimes when I play that old six string,
I think about you, wonder what went wrong.

Standin' on your mama's porch,
You told me that it'd last forever,
Oh, and when you held my hand,
I knew that it was now or never,
Those were the best days of my life - oh yeah.
