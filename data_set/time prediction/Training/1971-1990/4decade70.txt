Worried about old Johnny Lee Walker 
And the girl I left behind 

Now Johnny Lee Walker was a card mechanic 
Had a hand for trouble and a eye for cash 
Luckiest man in Dallas County 
He had a gold watch chain and a black mustache 

And he loved his whiskey and he loved his women 
Drove a big long Cadillac limosine 
Kept a big fine fancy townhouse in Dallas 
And a hotel suite in New Orleans 

Carried a switchblade knife in his left hip pocket 
And a .44 hog leg up under his coat 
Cut you down in a New York minute 
If he catch you cheating that was all she wrote 

So call up Trudy on the telephone 
Send her a letter in the mail 
Tell her I'm hung up in Dallas 
And they won't let me outta this jail

If she asks you how I'm fairing 
Tell her I'm just about to lose my mind 
Worried about old Johnny Lee Walker 
And the girl I left behind 

I just got to town last Friday evening 
Sure as hell didn't mean to stay 
I was on my way back to Louisiana 
Had a powerful thirst and six months pay 

I met a peroxide blonde in a bar on D-ville 
I was flying high and feeling mean 
Poured down a bottle and a half of red eye 
I dropped 35 dollars in the slot machine 

And the boys in the back was dealing 7 card 
I set down and won me a 110 
I was raking in chips like Grant took Richmond 
Till big Johnny Lee come a strolling in 

He ripped off the table like a 707 
Pretty soon he done won all of my bread 
I accused him of cheating he reached for a pistol 
I grabbed a chair and went upside of his head 

Then I took off a running like a motorcycle 
Heard the bullets whining and sirens wail 
But it took half the cops in Dallas County 
Just to put one boy in jail 

So call up Trudy on the telephone 
Send her a letter in the mail 
Tell her I'm hung up in Dallas 
And they won't let me outta this jail 

And if she asks you how I'm fairing 
Tell her I'm just about to lose my mind 
Worried about old Johnny Lee Walker 
And the girl I left behind
