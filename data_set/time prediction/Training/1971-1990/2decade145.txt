
Please come back baby, please don't go
For the way I love you you'll never know.
So come back baby, let's talk it over, one more time.

For the way I love you, you know I do,
For the way you love me, baby,
You never know.
Come back, baby, let's talk it over,
One more time.

You know I love you, tell the world I do,
For the way I love you, baby,
You'll never know.
So come back, baby, let's talk it over,
One more time.
