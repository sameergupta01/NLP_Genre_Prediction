
When you were languishing in rooms I built to foul you in,
And when the wind set down in funnel form and pulled you in...

I don't need to walk around in circles, walk around in circles,
Walk around in circles, walk around in.
I don't need to walk around in circles, walk around in circles,
Walk around in circles, walk around in.....

And when the ghostly dust of violence traces everything,
And when the gas runs out, just wreck it, you insured the thing.

I don't need to walk around in circles, walk around in circles,
Walk around in circles, walk around in.
I don't need to walk around in circles, walk around in circles,
Walk around in circles, walk around in.....

But I can't sigh now that you made the move.
It has gone and gone to dogs, lay down on the floor.
For the right price I can get everythng,
Slip into the car, go driving to the farthest star...

I don't need to walk around in circles, walk around in circles,
Walk around in circles, walk around in.
I don't need to walk around in circles, walk around in circles,
Walk around in circles, walk around in.....
