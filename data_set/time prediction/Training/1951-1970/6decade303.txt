
Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
She's my baby and she live next door
Every morning 'fore the sun comes up
She bring my coffee in my favorite cup

That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

When I'm in trouble and I have no friend
I know she'll go with me until the end
Everybody ask me how I know
I smile at them and say she told me so

That's why I know, oh, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her on my door

In the evening, when the sun go down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she hold me tight
And tells me, "Daddy, everything's alright"

That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her on my door

In the evening, when the sun go down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she hold me tight
And tells me, "Daddy, everything's alright"

That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
Oh, hallelujah
Don't you know I just love her so
She's my little woman way 'cross town
