Gripping the wheel,
His knuckles went white with desire.
The wheels of his Mustang exploding on the
highway like a slug from a .45.
True death: 400 horsepower of
maximum performance piercing the
night... This is black sunshine.

Move me in the silence
Baltic motorway
Hang me on the edge
Before I fall away
Apocalypse is dawnin'
Action on the mile
A "can-do" revolution
Earth to the river Nile

Sweeten the ride
Black Sunshine
Sweeten the ride
Yeah
Sweeten the ride
Black Sunshine
Sweeten the ride
Yeah!

Cry a river cosmic
Moon in Scorpio
eel her body breathe
Acid radio
Tell me that you like it
When I'm going down
Tell me that you like it
Move to the speed of sound

Sweeten the ride
Black Sunshine
Sweeten the ride
Yeah
Sweeten the ride
Black Sunshine
Sweeten the ride
Yeah
Go

Slide into I said a 44
Cool heart can hypnotize
Dream into infinity
I turned the love to lies
Crawl across the water way
And sink into the sea
Reflecting onto everything
That you can never be
Check-out
Yeah

To the devil a daughter comes
2000 worlds away
Yeah
Born to lose the love you choose
Destroy another day
Check out

Sweeten the ride
Black Sunshine
Sweeten the ride
Yeah
Sweeten the ride
Black Sunshine
Sweeten the ride
Yeah

Stare into the T.V.
Kiss off the pain
Wonderland is falling
No sing
No rain
Momentary
Damage into the high
Drift me to the circuit sky

Finally, nothing moves.
High noon. Blacktop rolling below the asphalt drive.
A concrete fascination, scraping the edge of nothing.
This is Black Sunshine.
