You move it to the left, yeah, you go for yourself
You move it to the right, yeah, if it takes all night
Now take it kinda slow with a whole lot of soul
Don't move it too fast and make it last

You scratch just like a monkey, yeah, you do, real, yeah
You slide into the limbo, yeah, how low can you go?
But come on, baby, I don't want you to scuffle now
You just groove it right here to the Harlem shuffle

Yeah, yeah, yeah, do the Harlem shuffle (Oh, do the monkey shine)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do the Harlem shuffle

Now come on, baby, now get into your slide
We're gonna ride, ride, ride, little pony ride

Shake, shake, shake, shake a tail feather, baby
