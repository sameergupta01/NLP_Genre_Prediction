Johnny Walker sat at a table at the bar, minding his own affairs
drinking his namesake over rocks, drunk, too drunk to care
when a girl in the bar walked up beside, and this is what she said
she said a woman came by with a letter for you and this is what the letter said

Dear John, please Johnny, please come home
I need your love and the kids, they gotta be fed
and John, if you don't hurry back, I'll be gone
Yes, that's what the letter said
the letter that Johnny Walker read

then John, he got up from the table, slowly he walked outside
he was thinking of his wife and little children back home
how his drinking had ruined their lives
then John, he stared off into that streetlight
and the vision filled his poor, poor heart with dread
for it was him, lying drunk in that gutter
clutching in his hand the letter that Johnny Walker read

Dear John, please Johnny, please come home
I need your love and the kids, they gotta be fed
and John, if you don't hurry back, I'll be gone
Yes, that's what the letter said
the letter that Johnny Walker read
