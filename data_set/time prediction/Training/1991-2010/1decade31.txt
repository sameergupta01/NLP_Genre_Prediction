I'm gonna take you down to the railway
line
I'm gonna take you down to the railway
line
I'm gonna take ya where your heart
won't break ya
And the water tastes like wine
I'm gonna take you down to the railway
line

We won't take money, we won't take the
long way round
We won't take money, we won't take the
long way round
We won't take money, we'll live off
honey
When the train goes underground

We won't take money, we won't take the
long way round
I'll drive faster
You'll hold tighter
I'll get wild
You'll get wilder
I'll make thunder
You'll make rain
We'll go down to the railway train

Clear that track we're coming on down
the line
Clear that track we're coming on down
the line
Clear that track they won't take us
back
They can stick it where the sun don't
shine
Clear that track we're coming on down
the line
