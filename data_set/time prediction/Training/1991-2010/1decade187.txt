
Where would we be without each other?
Two unembraced and lonely lovers
Everyone always goes back to girls
And I don't have a reason for that

Maybe I'll rely on the way you talk
The words drip from your mouth and into my heart
Unable to know my own existence
An utter lack of resistance

If you're going away
Please take me down
I can't stand on my own anymore
If you're runnin' away
To leave this town
We can't live on our own anymore
