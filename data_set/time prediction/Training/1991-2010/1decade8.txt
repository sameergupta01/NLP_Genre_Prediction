I read you
and God I'm good at it
I'm so spot on
Chord shapes in air
Compress that dissonance
If you dare
And you breathin' in
Finesse an innocent
From her partying

And I'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
And I'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
'Cause I love you, no?
Can't help but love, you know

What part of no
Don't you understand?
I've told you before
So just get off my case
This isn't happening
Stop this now
And I
Where was I?
I have to be somewhere
Now where did I put it?

And I'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
And I'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
'Cause I love you, no?
Can't help but love, you know

Is this it?
Is this it?
Is this it?
Yeah
Is this it?
No
Is this it?
Oh
Is this it?
No
Is this it?
No
Is this it?

Yes
Hello we're back
And we're taking calls
Now what was the question?

And I'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
And I'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
And I'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
And I'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
