I never knew there were such great movies
On TV at 3AM
I never guessed that at midnight Tuesday
I could have pizza ordered in
I never been a real night owl
But these days I'm all turned 'round
There's only one thing I'm sure of right now

CHORUS
I should be sleepin'
Instead of keepin' these late hours
I've been keepin'
I've been pacing and retracing
Every step of every move
And even though I'm feelin' so right
I'm so happy still I know
I should be sleepin'
Instead of dreamin' about you

I never knew that I was funny and
Til I went and made you laugh
Never like a girl to call me honey
But you did and I like that
I keep thinkin' about your smile
Tryin' to read between the lines
Looks like I'll be up for awhile

CHORUS

How could just three dates
One great kiss

It's way too soon
To be obsessing like this

CHORUS

Dreamin' about you
I should be sleepin'
