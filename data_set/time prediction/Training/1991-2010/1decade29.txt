I found the answer but I never liked it,
I took my baby to the 10 step platform,
I tied a reef knot, twice in the blindfold,
I whisper 20 steps and point direction.

CHORUS)
Crossfire doesn't burn you,
It only hurts when it gets you in the heart,
If you don't hate me,
You'll learn to,
I thought I had it clear from the start,
I don't have a heart

I call my baby just to hang on up the phone,
I take a raincheck, and never ever check the rain,
I leave the carton out for hours on summer days
I took a course on how to break the most hearts

CHORUS)
Crossfire doesn't burn you,
It only hurts when it gets you in the heart,
If you don't hate me,
You'll learn to,
I thought I had it clear from the start,
I don't have a heart.
