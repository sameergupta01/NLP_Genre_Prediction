
I walked along and I wound my way 'round
I saw a light shining bright
I'm not sure
Is it too late to call?
So, I keep my eyes to the floor

Oh, oh, I can't carry this load anymore
Oh, I'm too afraid to call on your door

I'm feeling so alone
Along a lonely road
I'm feeling so alone
Well, I'm comin' back

I walked along the water's edge
I saw my reflection stare back
I don't know where I'm going
But I know where I've been
Some days, I don't fit in my own skin

Oh, I can't carry this load anymore
Oh, I'm too afraid to call on your door
Oh, I can't carry this load anymore
Oh, I
I'm comin' back
Comin' back
