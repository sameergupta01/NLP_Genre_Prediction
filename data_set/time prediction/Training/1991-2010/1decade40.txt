
In my fear,
I fear 
We're seas apart in old worlds.
We began, 
In vibrant colors, 
But one of the things you said 
And i dread it.
That everything turns grey,
This is where i stray

I, I want so badly, 
To say that these things dont exist anymore.
When that indigo
Creeps upon me i cant deny
That i'm blue,
And not like you

When I look into your eyes at times
It's within them i find 
A love i never knew,
Still i'm bound to you.
Something inside so strong,


Wont settle in me somehow, i'm not free.

I want so badly, to say that these things dont exist anymore.
When that indigo creeps apon me i cant deny
That i'm blue.

It's past mistakes not hearts that break,
In moral laws respect they take and
Now
It still effects me to. 
If my one enemy is me,
Then tell me how to stay true and not be blamed by you. 

I, I want so badly to say that these things 
Anymore.
When that indigo 
I cant deny that i'm blue.
I, I want so badly to say that these things dont exist anymore.
When that indigo creeps upon me i cant deny
That i'm blue, 
And not like you.
