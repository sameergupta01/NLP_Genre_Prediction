Title : What Say You
Album : My Honky Tonk History
Genre : Country

I believe that there's a right &amp; I believe that there's a wrong
That north and south, black &amp; white
Can somehow get along
What say you, What say you

I believe there's a basic good in the heart of every man
And I'm not gonna criticize what I can't understand
What say you
What say you

I'm not afraid to say what's on my mind, To take a stand, to draw the line
To speak my heart &amp; bare my soul, 
I don't like lies, I'd rather know the truth 
Hey, what say you, What say you

But I'm not ashamed of where I come from, 
With this blue collar on my shirt
And I don't look for handouts, 
Cause I'm not afraid of work
What say you, 
Yeah, what say you

Man, I don't talk no religion &amp; I ain't gonna wave that flag
But I love God &amp; America &amp; I'd fight for what I have
What say you
Yeah, what say you

I know I'm not always right
I don't think I'm better than you
I don't have all the answers 
But I'll share my point of view

What say you

I'm not afraid to say what's on my mind
Take a stand &amp; draw that line
To speak my heart &amp; bare my soul
I don't like lies, I'd rather know the truth

So what say you
What say you
What say you and you and you and you ...
What say you
