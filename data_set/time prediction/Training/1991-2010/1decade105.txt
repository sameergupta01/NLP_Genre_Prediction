
There's a time and place
A show and face
And that time is now

There are ways and means
Of keeping faith
Don't drown them out

Through the round window there is light
In the mirror there is flight
Behind the closed door there is a reason
And it is waiting for you

You only get what you left behind
Do you remember living for the first time?
When the leaves fall, will you still be there?
When the wind blows, will you show you care?
The crow will tell me what's been said
Don't hide from your own head

Behind the closed door there is a reason
And it is waiting for you

The colour drains from our eyes
And joins the turning tide
I've tried my best to make it clear
I've traded trust for hope and fear
And all is quiet now
The Moon was in the clouds
